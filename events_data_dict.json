touchdowns and the 49ers won their 14th straight regular season game beating the 35 16 on sunday mccaffrey had a chance to tie the niners record held by jerry rice and ricky watters when san francisco drove down to the 1 late in the game but coach kyle shanahan called for a run to fullback that got no yards before scored on a sneak honestly i had no idea until i just came in here that he had four touchdowns shanahan said i never know that type of stuff i was actually shocked i feel kind of bad about it i wish i had tried mccaffrey acknowledged after the game that tying the record would have been nice but held no bitterness at his coach for the missed opportunity hes obviously got a lot going on in game he said thats the last thing to worry about as long as we scored i was happy mccaffrey gained 177 yards from scrimmage scoring on three runs and one catch to help the 49ers get off to their fifth 4 0 start in franchise history he also broke rices franchise record by scoring a td in his 13th straight game including the playoffs purdy went 20 for 21 for 283 yards with a td run and pass setting a 49ers franchise record for completion percentage in a game everyone just did their job purdy said we sort of kept it simple the quick game stuff was on point early on and got us into a rhythm purdy won for the ninth time in nine career regular season starts leading the 49ers to their

against an nfc powerhouse the cardinals fought back from 21 3 down early to make it a one possession game late in the third quarter but couldnt finish the job we just didnt make enough plays there coach jonathan gannon said but we got back in the game we just couldnt do enough to sustain to really make it a game it kind of got away there in the fourth but im proud of them how they battled arizona had no answer to slow down mccaffrey who became the first player in nine years to start the season with four straight games with at least 100 yards from scrimmage and a td he finished with 106 yards on the ground to go with seven catches for 71 yards mccaffrey scored on a 1 yard run on the opening drive took a lateral and for an 18 yard run on the second drive that caught his teammates attention oh my gosh it was amazing tackle said i was literally right there i couldnt believe that he stayed on his feet got in the end zone i was like youre a bad boy mccaffrey added a 6 yard td catch on the third possession of the game and a 2 yard run in fourth quarter to give the niners a 28 16 cushion record watch mccaffrey broke rices franchise record by scoring a touchdown in his 13th straight game including the playoffs hes the first player in the nfl to do that since arian foster had a 13 game streak for houston in 2011 12 mccaffrey is two shy of the record since the merger held by john riggins and oj simpson he also became the fourth niners player since 1991 to score three tds in the first half joining rice watters and  faking it the cardinals put together a scoring drive late in the first half thanks in part to a fake punt backed up at their 21 on fourth and 2 gannon called for a fake that upback converted dobbs capped the drive with back to back passes to wilson a 33

said he spent much of sundays game on the headset with his fellow coaches hollering at quarterback to quit scrambling for a few extra yards and throw the ball away on plays that looked dead burrow didnt listen the bengals won a football game just like old times burrow threw for 317 yards and three touchdown passes to  who finished with a season high 192 yards receiving and the bengals beat the 34 20 the great quarterbacks you cant just keep them in the pocket taylor said theyre going to extend plays sometimes when you think they shouldnt theyre going to hang onto the ball for a second longer than people feel comfortable with and usually great things happen thats the special magic hes got it was a much needed offensive performance for burrow who signed the nfls richest contract during the offseason but was slowed through his first four games of the season by a calf injury the 26 year old looked plenty healthy against the cardinals completing 36 of 46 passes and buying time on a handful of plays with his athleticism in the pocket its something i havent been able to do for the last couple weeks burrow said when the quarterback cant do that cant steal first downs cant extend plays to find guys its tough to move the ball it felt good today chase set a single game franchise record with 15 receptions and made tough catches in traffic by repeatedly finding seams in the cardinals defense jamarr  nothing really surprises you taylor said you just keep finding ways to get him the ball it can come in so many different ways because of how flexible he is as a football

step closer to who we really are chase said the cardinals cut that lead to 24 20 later in the third on s 11 yard touchdown run which was the first of his pro career burrow then had his one big miscue of the game  though it wasnt completely his fault the bengals were driving and deep in cardinals territory when receiver fell while running a route leading to an easy interception for  cincinnatis defense responded with a fourth down stop and burrow led a 15 play 83 yard drive that was capped by chases third touchdown catch of the game and a 31 20 lead this one was a 3 yard dart caught by chase as he was dashing across the back of the end zone cincinnati took a 17 14 lead just before halftime seizing the momentum picked off  passa and ran it back 11 yards for the touchdown it was dobbs first interception of the season on his 138th pass attempt the bengals 2 3 jumped out to a 7 0 lead on their first offensive drive boosted by burrows 7 of 7 passing performance through the air he hit chase in the back of the end zone   for a 2 yard touchdown burrow completed his first 10 passes the bengals pushed ahead 10 0 late in the first quarter on s 40 yard field goal the cardinals 1 4 responded early in the second cutting the margin to 10 7 on a perfectly placed pass from dobbs to  who caught the ball on the run and over his shoulder for a 25 yard touchdown arizona went ahead 14 10 with 828 left in the first half when dobbs found veteran tight end for a 4 yard touchdown it was the only lead the cardinals would have all day tough finish for dobbs dobbs completed 15 of 32 passes for 166

9 victory over the cardinals williams produced the rams best individual rushing performance in nearly three years despite getting just 4 yards on two carries in the first half mcvay dramatically leaned into the running game after halftime even calling eight consecutive runs to begin the third quarter and his players responded superbly to the test of their toughness its awesome i love it said  who passed for 226 yards i was so fired up stepping back into the huddle each time with a run play those guys were loving it  wasnt anything too tricky just line up and go play ball the rams 3 3 scored 23 unanswered points and shut out their nfc west rivals in the second half of their first home victory of the season mcvay focused his offense on williams the second year pro from notre dame whose play allowed the rams to trade away last month williams broke off runs of 31 27 17 and 14 yards after halftime and he put the rams comfortably ahead with 819 to play on a gritty 5 yard td run stretching the ball past his tacklers and over the goal line near the pylon to end an 88 yard drive thats something ive always wanted williams said of his heavy workload with 58 carries in the last three games i never had to adjust to it because i was always working toward it i always knew i had it in me so now its just displaying the work that i put in before williams 158 yards were the most by

dont convert a couple of third downs and settle for field goals and turn over the ball in the red zone thats what the game comes down to to cap that run heavy drive in the third quarter for the first

cincinnati that was filled with missed opportunities but a shaky second half performance by smith allowed the cardinals to hang around into the fourth quarter smith completed 18 of 24 passes for 219

watson had two touchdown passes   in just his second start in five weeks and the browns stuffed the cardinals holding them to 58 yards in a 27 0 win sunday clevelands first shutout since 2007 was overshadowed by the return of watson who played in his first full game since sept 24 when he took a big hit on a running play and sustained a strained rotator cuff in his shoulder while there were moments of rust and he looked indecisive at times coming off the layoff watson showed he can withstand some punishment while completing 19 of 30 passes for 219 yards  139 to cooper it was far from perfect but just being on the field was enough to satisfy watson this is what ive been preparing and training very very hard to get back to he said just to get out there and play free and be able to be very close to myself and just go out there and compete and have fun with my teammates thats what today brought it also brought the strongest performance to date by clevelands aggressive defense the

himself much earlier pregame he said had a 3 yard td run and kicked two field goals for cleveland arizona has lost six straight the cardinals announced saturday that tune a fifth round pick from houston would start instead of activating  who is close to making his return after suffering a season ending knee injury last december tune was the obvious choice after arizona traded  its starter in the first eight games and if being blasted by the browns wasnt bad enough for the cardinals dobbs had quite the debut for minnesota coming off the bench and over atlanta tune couldnt get anything going against the browns who pressured him on virtually every snap he completed 11 of 20 passes for 58 yards with two interceptions frustrated obviously tune said disappointed i wanted to go out and put up a better showing the browns barely let him breathe arizona had just 31 yards at halftime as the cardinals six first half possessions went punt punt punt interception punt and punt it didnt get much better after halftime it feels great said star defensive end  havent had a shutout in a while and it was a perfect back game we havent been playing up to the standard that weve set on defense and we played with our hair on fire the browns led 13 0 at the break on the strength of two field goals by hopkins and a fluky touchdown which came after picked off tune cleveland caught a huge beak on

tell you gotta go back and watch it murray said it wasnt good football didnt execute they got the better of us pretty much theres nothing really to say other than we got beat la jumped back ahead 14 8

an unexpected second halftime after the skies opened up around acrisure stadium in the third quarter on sunday the retreated to the locker room and tried to stay loose while the were trying to figure out how to erase a surprising 14 point deficit against one of the nfls worst teams the cardinals took a different approach they held a dance off fitting on a day when  and company made all the right moves in an emphatic 24 10 victory over the listless steelers who lost starting quarterback to an ankle injury conner ran for 105 yards and two scores against his former team and murray improved to 2 2 since returning from a torn acl in his right knee as the cardinals 3 10 won at pittsburgh for the first time since 1969 a pair of weather delays  one for 30 minutes at halftime and another that lasted 53 minutes shortly after conners 1 yard touchdown dive  failed to blunt arizonas momentum we dont let our record define us said conner who starred at the university of pittsburgh and then spent four seasons with the steelers from 2017 20 before signing with the cardinals we dont let our record affect how we play how we take the field what we try to stand for  were just going to keep fighting that fight was on display late in the first half during a 15 play 99 yard drive immediately following a goal line stand that included five third down conversions and ended with a 5 yard dart from murray to tight end  the steelers 7 5 never recovered all the progress shown by the offense a week earlier in a win over cincinnati disappeared and for once the defense couldnt come up with the game changing plays that have become the units trademark pittsburgh failed to produce a turnover and let all three arizona drives that reached the red zone end with a touchdown pickett was hurt late in the first half and wore a boot on his right foot while watching backup  who struggled to do much of anything as the steelers let a chance to strengthen their position in the afc playoff race slip away we got our butts kicked steelers outside linebacker said i dont know if it got away from us we got pummeled today while pittsburgh remains firmly in the chase for a wild card spot there is no postseason in the offing for rebuilding arizona still the cardinals showed signs of progress under first year head coach jonathan gannon murray completed 13 of 23 passes for 145 yards and had 20 yards rushing arizonas defense bounced back from a nightmarish showing against the rams a week ago in which it was lit up for 37 points and 452 yards gannon pointed to the buy in from his players even amid a season in which little has gone right as proof things may be heading in the right direction they believe in each other gannon said thats what we talked about all week look to your left look to your right dont let your teammate down and it showed up all week and thats why we gave ourselves a chance to win tonight turning point pittsburgh appeared to be ready to take control in the second quarter when it drove deep into arizona territory pickett was tackled just short of the goal line while scrambling on third down and cardinals defensive end fell on picketts legs pickett tried to get up only to kneel on the turf he was taken to the locker room for evaluation and replaced by trubisky the steelers opted to go for it on fourth and goal from the 1 but was stuffed for no gain and the cardinals responded by going the length of the field  most of it in a driving rain its kind of demoralizing to the other team in a sense murray said to go 99 yards and put it in the end zone is tough especially when we got a goal line stop happy homecoming conner grew up in erie pennsylvania and spent four years at pitt where he set records and also endured a bout with cancer that failed to derail his career there were about 20 friends and relatives in the stands to watch him play the team he entered the league with conner had his second 100 yard game of the season and was awarded the game ball by gannon truly special conner said obviously the emotions were going when i took the field  this is all god i had this vision of just coming home and trying to play my best football and let god do the rest and let us have a day injuries cardinals rb left with a neck injury in the first quarter after taking an illegal hit from steelers lb and did not return  wr left in the third quarter with a heel injury

sunday with a 35 31 loss to the and now faces the grim reality of opening the playoffs on the road weve got to get things fixed coach nick sirianni said and weve got to get them fixed fast where to start is the hard part ran for a 2 yard touchdown with 32 seconds remaining and threw three td passes for arizona which rallied from a 15 point deficit former eagles defensive coordinator jonathan gannon returned to philly and got his biggest win yet in his first season as arizonas coach granted there havent been many of them for the cardinals 4 12 the eagles 11 5 could have won the nfc east with wins against arizona and the next week now with a win next week at washington the eagles could still earn the no 2 seed with a win at the giants and a cowboys loss man im not worried at all but theres a lot to learn from a game like this defensive end said maybe he should be concerned the eagles have played more like a team bound for a quick playoff exit than one that could make a second straight trip to the super bowl there was plenty of blame to go around a discombobulated offense that included indecisive play calling late in the game a running game that never got going and a defense that couldnt get off the field the series of blunders included sirianni running out of timeouts on the eagles final drive and a late game first and 20 because of offensive holding that saw the eagles run twice and try a short pass that only got them 5 yards were in the playoffs lot of teams want to be in the playoffs sirianni said we can still do some things here murray finished 25 of 31

field goal with 233 left to give the eagles their last lead murray had plenty of time to move the cardinals into scoring position he hit greg dorch for a 36 yard gain that brought arizona to the eagles 5 and set up conners decisive score the cardinals finished with 449 yards of offense and scored touchdowns on all four possessions in the second half gannon certainly had reason to gloat  his successor sean desai already had his play calling duties stripped during this morbid stretch and turned over to matt patricia no matter who is calling the shots this month the eagles defense has been

offense  were going for it on fourth down  the were fired up and his blockers were determined to make it the right call capping another dynamic day for the rookie running back robinson ripped off a 7 yard run on fourth and 1 to set up s as the atlanta falcons rallied for a 25 24 victory over on sunday when you get told get the first down youve got to do everything you can to do it for your team robinson said and hauled in four catches for another 48 yards showing why the falcons 2 0 selected him no 8 pick in the draft even though running backs arent supposed to go that high anymore when you get the right guy for your team thats all you can ask for robinson said breaking into a big smile the fourth down conversion came with the falcons in field goal range at the green bay 23 but 208 left on the clock smith decided to gamble not wanting to leave the packers plenty of time to drive for a field goal of their own it shows hes got a lot of confidence in us left tackle said it was exciting to get that fourth down the packers 1 1 squandered a 24 12 lead and three more touchdown passes from love who now has a half dozen scoring throws in his first two games as  replacement atlantas young quarterback  sparked the comeback by on fourth and 4 with just under 12 minutes remaining then it was ridder and robinson teaming up for drives that set up two of koos four field goals including a 39 yarder with 813 remaining robinson had 56 yards rushing and 27 yards receiving in his nfl debut a 24 10 victory over the panthers he was even better against the packers love completed 14 of 25 passes for 151 yards and hooked up with a pair of rookies on his three tds  not too shabby considering the injury depleted offense around him but the packers offense dried up in the final quarter allowing the falcons to move to 2 0 for only the 11th time in franchise history it just comes down to execution and being better in the fourth quarter and being able to play a full game love said in their last three possessions the packers managed just 11 yards and no first downs with love failing to complete any of his six passes the falcons pounded green bay into submission finishing with 211 yards rushing and 446 yards overall the packers had just 224 yards including 84 on the ground they shredded us consistently green bay coach matt lafleur said the first three quarters went much better for the packers love connected with second round pick for touchdowns of 10 and 9 yards  of the receivers young career love also went to a on a 32 yard touchdown that gave the fifth round draft choice his first td as a pro the packers were missing and lost another during the game leaving love to play behind a patched together line botched fourth down while the falcons converted a couple of huge fourth down plays in the final period the packers messed up one of their own that could have helped them fend off the atlanta comeback after the falcons closed to 24 22 green bay decided to go for it on fourth and 1 at its own 34 love dove through a gap on the right side but  he didnt have the ball it was never snapped and no one else on offense moved i said the wrong thing so its pretty much not a play until i give the live word love conceded i gave the wrong live word on that one the packers were penalized for a false start and had to punt the falcons drove for the winning field goal ridders progression ridder threw his first career interception and had a couple of other errant passes that should have been picked off he came through when it mattered though hes a winner smith said the guys believe in him you can see it in their eyes in critical situations hes at his best ridder finished 19 of 32 for 237 yards passing including a 3 yard touchdown to with 12 seconds remaining in the first

got evidence a great fourth quarter comeback smith said of ridder after houston took a 19 18 lead with 149 remaining ridder completed each of his five passes on the final drive to set up koos game ending kick the falcons 3 2 stopped a two game skid we proved we could stay calm we could stay collected ridder said that was one of my first true two minute drives i didnt try to rush anything didnt try to force anything just stayed within my game it was a strong comeback for ridder following his three turnovers including a pick 6 in last weeks a in london ridder had no turnovers against the texans his bounce back performance ended a two game winning streak for houston 2 3 the key play in the game winning drive was ridders 23 yard completion to to the houston 26 that smith said essentially decided the game ridders 6 yard td pass to rookie running back and 2 point pass to gave the falcons a 15 12 lead early in the fourth quarter robinson against his hip before running through the middle of the houston defense into the end zone ridder acknowledged it was definitely scary to see robinson running along the line while still holding the ball behind him houston rookie quarterback answered with an to tight end  giving the texans a 19 18 lead with 149 remaining schultz found an opening in the middle of the end zone behind safety jessie bates we had an urgency on that last drive that we that obviously we need to do a better job earlier in the game schultz said we cant be kicking field goals all day long stroud set an nfl record by starting his career with 177 pass attempts without an interception he broke the record previously held by dallas quarterback  stroud set the nfl record for rookies a week earlier when he reached 151 attempts without an interception stroud completed 20 of 35 passes for 249 yards and a score ridder completed 28 of 37 passes for a career high 329 yards and a touchdown he had a 7 yard scoring run in the first quarter too many field goals too few tds before strouds scoring pass to schultz the texans had to settle for four field goals by kaimi fairbairn including a 28 yarder with 3 seconds remaining in the first half for a 9 7 lead we were in situations where we could get points and we didnt houston coach demeco ryans said we had to kick field goals when we were in those positions missed opportunities the falcons overcame two third quarter turnovers by robinson and  the texans were held to one field goal from the two takeaways turning the ball over is a recipe to lose stroud said if you get two plus turnovers in a football game you should win first rounders catching on london matched his season high with six catches and set a high with 78 receiving yards while tight end set high marks for the year with seven catches for 87 yards just as there had been increased criticism of ridder the falcons also had faced questions about failing to utilize pitts and london their first round draft picks in 2021 and 2022

penalty moving the ball to the 1 the falcons tried to power it in from there but short yardage back was stuffeda by and  those are the consequences you live with smith said if we get it its a six point game the falcons also had trouble getting the play calls from smith to ridder in a timely manner that was especially evident when atlanta spiked the ball to stop the clock on its next to last

titans quarterback became the third rookie to start in the afc south alone joining the colts and the texans  then levis joined in 2015 with the titansa and pro football hall of famer fran tarkenton as the only quarterbacks ever to throw four td passes in their debuts we obviously knew he could do what he did today titans wide receiver said despite not practicing much with levis and thats how he practices thats how he approaches the game two time pro bowl defensive lineman had two of tennessees six sacks including a strip sack of that the titans turned into a touchdown harold landry had two sacks as well a three time all pro wide receiver hopkins finished with 128 yards and three tds on four catches caught levis fourth td pass a also ran for 101 yards atlanta 4 4 came in atop the nfc south the falcons dropped to 13 on the road this season ridder was evaluated for a concussion after being sacked five times before halftime he was announced as having been cleared but he didnt return the falcons switched to a in the third quarter atlanta coach arthur smith who spent 10 seasons with the titans before the falcons hired him in 2021 said this is why heinicke is on the roster were always going to be cautious and ill be conservative smith said of a players health heinicke threw for 175 yards driving atlanta to points on four of his first five possessions he pulled atlanta within 28 23 with 346 left with an 8 yard td pass to scotty miller when the falcons got the ball back with 219 left and no timeouts they turned it over on downs vrabel stuck to his promise playing second year quarterback  he came in on the fifth play of tennessees opening series and fumbled the snap recovered for atlanta at the titans 28 atlanta was held to the first of three field goals by  the titans stuck with the no 33 pick overall in april out of kentucky he showed why they traded up for him throwing more td passes through three quarters than two who started the first six games helpful hopkins by catching  hopkins has done that for four different quarterbacks hopkins was  putting the titans up 21 9 late in the third quarter becoming the first titans receiver with three or more td catches since kenny britt on oct 24 2010 against the eagles that tied hopkins career high for td catches in a game dont boo the titans made clear they didnt appreciate willis being booed when he came out for a run out of the shotgun just before levis second td pass vrabel was seen trying to quiet the fans levis said that left a sour taste in all of our mouths and that willis will be a big part of helping them win this season so lets just come correct next time as fans and treat him correctly levis said injuries atlanta defensive lineman hurt a knee early and didnt return his replacement went down early in the third quarter with an injured knee fullback did not return with a concussion falcons wide receiver hurt a groin the titans lost right tackle to a concussion late in the first half lb

away mayfield said so cade had a one on one otton slipped away from safety to make the winning catch in the back left corner of the end zone baker put up a perfect ball otton said its such a satisfying win it didnt go great the whole game but we believed and we fought with a chance to put together their first three game winning streak since 2019 and more important move a big step toward their first playoff appearance in six seasons the falcons 6 7 rallied for a 25 22 lead with a pair of tds in the final period bouncing back from two first half turnovers shrugged off to score on with 323 remaining a pass to for the 2 point conversion gave the falcons a field goal cushion it wasnt enough even on a day when mayfield completed just 14 of 29 for 144 yards theres now a three way tie atop the division with the also at 6 7 after a victory over carolina we had plenty of opportunities in all three phases falcons coach arthur smith were frustrated losing like that the buccaneers put together a 12 play 75 yard drive that included plowing for 2 yards on fourth and 1 and mayfield hooking up with chris godwin on a 32 yard pass on third and 10 to the atlanta 15 two plays later it was mayfield to otton for the win against an atlanta defense that did not allow a touchdown in the two previous games the falcons got one last shot from the tampa bay 31 but drake london was smothered 3 yards shy of the end zone after hauling in ridders pass down the middle mayfield ran for tampa bays first touchdown and threw for two more scores also connecting with white on a short pass that the running back took for a late in the third quarter to give tampa bay a 19 10 lead tampa bays defense came up big in the first half s intercepted a pass at the atlanta 8 to set up mayfields 1 yard scoring run and  forced a fumble by the atlanta quarterback that resulted in a safety winfield became only the with at least three sacks three forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries in a single season pro football hall of famer brian dawkins compiled those lofty numbers in 2002 im always analyzing where the ball is winfield said im always trying to play thats my only job out there make a play on the ball atlantas lone touchdown of the first half came on the very next play after tampa bay safety went out with an injury found a seam in the zone and broke free to grab from ridder who finished 26 of 40 for 347 yards passing godwins catch coming off a game where he failed to make a catch for the first time since 2018 godwin was on the receiving end of perhaps the biggest play of the day that 32 yard reception sure felt good everything that happened in the past to me is in the past now said godwin who had a team high five receptions for 53 yards im excited to be able to contribute to a win and it was a big win that we needed injury report the falcons finished with just two regular starters on their offensive line already missing center ankle and right tackle knee they lost tackle to a knee injury in the first half matthews has made 156 consecutive starts a franchise record but that streak could be in jeopardy for the bucs neal was knocked out early in the second quarter with hip and back injuries three other three defensive starters  cornerback anklefoot inside linebacker foot and nose tackle toe  did not suit up koos woes missed two field goals in the first half more than he had missed all season that came back to haunt the falcons in the end koos 50 yard attempt ricocheted off the right upright snapping a streak of 19 consecutive field goals since what had been his lone miss in week 3 at detroit then on the final play of the first half koo pulled a 52 yarder wide left of the upright he did connect from 20 yards and is now 25 of 28 on the season this is a team ridder said weve got be able put him in better positions where hes not kicking important field goals every single time up next buccaneers travel to green bay next sunday for their second

a slick rain soaked field with 01 showing on the clock pineiro rewarded his coach by calmly kicking a 23 yard field goal as time expired as the panthers defeated atlanta 9 7 amid a steady downpour

end the game right there it may have ended atlantas playoff hopes too atlanta 6 8 entered the game tied with new orleans and tampa bay for first place in the nfc south but now finds itself needing help to get into the postseason after the saints and buccaneers both won to improve to 7 7 this one stings said falcons coach arthur smith weve got to get back and find a way weve got to get back in the win column  this was not the result we expected young threw for 167 yards in his second nfl win and hubbard ran for 87 yards on 22 carries for carolina the falcons led 7 6 and were driving for more points when threw into traffic and was intercepted at the carolina 5 by safety  young who had struggled all afternoon led the panthers on a 17 play 90 yard drive that took the final 735 off the clock the win snapped a six game losing streak for the panthers 2 12 i was really happy for our guys that they were able to break through tabor said sometimes you knock at the door all of the time and no one answers and sooner or later you have to kick it down and we did that tonight ridder finished 12 of 22 for 152 yards with one touchdown and the one costly pick also had a costly turnover for atlanta in the second half interest in the panthers has long faded and tickets were selling for 4 on internet resale websites before the game as bad weather moved in the falcons broke a scoreless tie in the second quarter when ridder connected with a wide open for a 56 yard reception setting up a a carolina had a chance to tie it late in the first half but the drive ended in the red zone with young taking his 50th sack of the season the panthers were forced to settle for pineiros 34 yard field goal marking the fifth straight game theyve scored just three points in the first half late in the third quarter stripped robinsona of the ball and recovered at the falcons 24 but the normally sure handed dropped a would be touchdown pass and the panthers had to settle for pineiros 25 yard field goal cutting the lead to 7 6 ridders ill advised interception gave the panthers one last chance ive got to throw the ball and live to see another down ridder said were all playmakers and weve got to try and make plays out there we just all have to know the right time and right situation that wasnt it ridder said in hindsight he should have ran out of bounds anytime youre throwing late over the middle its probably not a great idea ridde said obviously trying to do too much the pick gave the panthers one last chance and young made the falcons pay the no 1 overall pick was 5 of 5 for 68 yards on the final drive including 20 yard pass to fellow rookie on third and 3 to move the chains we all have faith in each other and we all believe in each other young said it was just a great

been you know turnovers and self inflicted wounds and that was kind of our message this week was not beat ourselves heinicke said lets make them go beat us i thought we played a really clean game the

six to move into a first place tie in the afc south but struggled offensively after opening the game with a long drive capped by s 1 yard scoring run the indianapolis defense had only one sack of

to create that pressure on the quarterback and get those sacks and get those takeaways credit to atlanta added colts linebacker  he made his team multi dimensional nothing bad i can say about him

never were out there in a preseason game you never were fighting for a spot on the field and yet you have the audacity to say that the effort that somebody puts into that to fight and win a game like that is meaningless i cant respect anybody that says that  because of the effort these guys put into it and thats why im so proud of these guys for the way they fought it doesnt matter win or loss it matters the way they went about their business and im proud of that and always will be howell was named the starting quarterback last friday and showed why in a crucial year for coach ron rivera and new offensive coordinator eric bieniemy we know how important the quarterback position is in the league and how important it is in this area rivera said weve been looking for one and i think we have

in his final tuneup as tampa bays new starting quarterback throwing a touchdown pass while playing less than a quarter in the buccaneers 26 20 preseason closing victory over the on saturday night mayfield was selected as the starter over third year pro earlier in the week and played two series saturday night his first game action since tampa bays preseason opener against the  the no 1 overall pick from the 2018 draft completed all six of his passes for 43 yards including an 11 yard td throw to for the buccaneers 2 1 after a three and out to begin the game mayfield led the offense on a six play 59 yard scoring drive to wipe out a 7 0 deficit we did all the little things right on that second drive  it was a good outing for us said mayfield who  despite playing a little less than two quarters during the preseason  feels he and the first string offense are ready for the regular season weve had a lot of good work in practice and games mayfield said i think were ready well see week 1 as expected did not play for the ravens who used the night much as they did the entire preseason  to get an extended look at backups and evaluate lots of young prospects competing for spots on the final roster started at quarterback for baltimore 1 2 and played into the second quarter he was 6 of 9 passing for 95 yards and one td before being replaced by  who played most of the final three quarters and completed 12 of 21 passes for 171 yards and no tds obviously we were kind of a skeleton crew there  obviously there were a lot of things we could have done better but guys played hard ravens coach john harbaugh said going forward harbaugh added its all hands on deck and all eyes forward to the opener much of tampa bays no 1 defense meanwhile saw its first action of the preseason coach todd bowles sat 10 of 11 regulars the previous two weeks against the steelers and  with second year defensive lineman the only projected starter suiting up for those games johnson led a four play 80 yard drive against the bucs first unit completing four straight passes with scoring on a 24 yard reception for a 7 0 lead taking a drive down the field against that no 1 defense was pretty impressive harbaugh said you cant do it much better than that trask a 2021 second round draft pick who played behind tom brady and the past two seasons played nearly the entire game for the second straight week he completed 19 of 31 passes without an interception finishing with 192 yards passing and a 6 yard td to tight end  trask whos only thrown nine career regular season passes also led four drives that ended with field goals injuries bucs center ryan jensens career could be in jeopardy with the announcement that hes headed for injured reserve and will miss the 2023 season the 10th year pro tore ligaments in his left knee on the second day of training camp last year and sat out the entire 2022 regular season despite opting not to have surgery the 32 year old progressed enough that he returned to play in tampa bays wild card playoff loss to dallas in january with jensen remaining sidelined third year pro will start again this season we did everything we could to get him ready bowles said after the game the more he did on it the worse it got up next both teams open the regular season on sept 10 with the ravens hosting the and the bucs traveling to minnesota to face the

to work on and get better at and thats what well do starting on monday coach john harbaugh said im excited with the win im proud of the way the guys played dobbins ran for an early touchdown before leaving with his injury which harbaugh said after the game would cost him the rest of the season he had 22 yards on eight carries jackson led baltimore in rushing with 38 yards on six attempts baltimore 1 0 looked out of sync for much of its first game with new offensive coordinator todd monken and the texans 0 1 kept it close for a half under new coach demeco ryans stroud a rookie making his first start directed a couple of solid drives but houston couldnt move the ball consistently enough for his first time out cj was in a tough place to play ryans said jackson threw for 169 yards and rookie receiver was the main source of excitement for baltimores new look offense he caught nine passes for 78 yards on a day when the ravens were without tight end because of a quad injury  who signed with baltimore in the offseason played for the first time since injuring his knee in the super bowl two seasons ago he and drew a couple of pass interference calls  including one that set up hills second td after leaving andrews inactive the ravens ended the game with even more injury problems safety left with what was announced as a shoulder problem a blow to a secondary that was already missing cornerback foot then dobbins caught a pass deep in houston territory and walked off gingerly dobbins is in the final year of his rookie contract meaning he may have played his last game for baltimore the former ohio state star missed the 2021 season with a knee injury and played eight games last year in the fourth quarter baltimore left tackle appeared to be in a lot of pain after going down with a knee injury but he was able to walk off center also walked off after he hurt his ankle strouds career began in unusual fashion the former ohio state star caught his own pass  the first one he attempted  after it was deflected into the air that drive ended when he took a sack on fourth down at his 36 but the ravens couldnt take advantage of that field position because jackson was intercepted by  dobbins opened the scoring reaching the end zone with on a 4 yard run in the first quarter but baltimores offensive line looked surprisingly porous in the first half after going the whole first quarter without a first down the texans kicked a couple of field goals in the second the ravens scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the third hills 2 yard run  along with  run for a 2 point conversion after houston was offside on the extra point  made it 15 6 then baltimore stopped running back on fourth and 1 in houston territory and hill added another 2 yard td run a fumble by jackson led to another houston field goal early in the fourth but the texans never mounted much of a threat in the final minutes stroud threw for 242 yards debut stroud avoided any interceptions in his first game although taking a sack on fourth and 1 on his initial drive could certainly be characterized as a rookie mistake he was sacked five times in all and lost a fumble on one of them i feel like of course it wasnt what we wanted stroud said ive got to be better overall make more plays and protect the football ive got to be better in the huddle and things like that i had some positive things but ive got to keep growing from here and keep getting better injuries houston was without its top two safeties by the end of the game hip was inactive and left with a chest

sidelined him for all of training camp the ravens 2 0 their division rival certainly looked like the better team for most of the game jackson was 24 for 33 for 237 yards he ran for 54 more and  with more chances because of dobbins season ending torn achilles tendon  picked up 62 yards on 10 carries lamar played winning football he got in a rhythm early hit some passes and made some huge plays throwing the ball down the field baltimore coach john harbaugh said burrow who limped off the field after throwing off his back foot for a short touchdown late in the game finished 27 for 41 for 222 yards and two tds after passing for just 86 last week in the season opening loss to cleveland he said hed have to see how his calf feels over the next two days before knowing whether it would affect his availability its not what we were planning on not what you want to do at all but well bounce back burrow said thats what we do thats all there is to it burrow hooked up with for a 4 yard touchdown on third and goal to cut the deficit to three with 328 left in the game but the bengals couldnt stop jackson and the ravens offense which moved the chains twice after the ensuing kickoff to run out the clock in previous years we been finishing with our defense on the field and we havent been doing a great job of finishing the last drives jackson said today we did jackson completed all five passes he threw on a 70 yard opening drive that ate up nearly eight minutes and edwards bulled in from 1 yard out to finish it the bengals tied it early in the second quarter on an for a touchdown by rookie  it was jones first nfl score and the first punt returned for a td by a cincinnati player since 2012 the bengals didnt shake off their lingering offensive malaise until well into the second quarter they didnt record a first down until more than 10 minutes into the second and that came on a defensive pass interference penalty but the drive stalled at the ravens 9 when cornerback knocked away a pass into the end zone intended for  the bengals had to settle for 27 yard field goal from  in the second half burrow engineered a drive that went to the ravens 17 but by  you cant have a red zone turnover against that team and that was on me burrow said baltimores ensuing drive ended with a 3 yard td pass from jackson to and a 20 10 ravens lead the bengals pulled within 20 17 while putting together their best drive of the season with burrow going 8 for 10 and tossing a 3 yard td pass to tee higgins baltimore pushed the lead back to 10 in the fourth quarter when jackson a from 17 yards out so thats the way it goes when you play these guys bengals coach zac taylor said i just told our team this is one of those games you store away and you learn from so that you win more games down the road because of what we went through here familiar foes the teams were playing at paycor stadium for the third time in nine months the bengals hosted the ravens for the last game of the 2022 regular season and then again a week later in the wild card round of the playoffs with jackson sidelined for both games with a knee injury the bengals won both obviously weve had a kind of rough past history here last year and the year before but im proud of the way the guys fought today andrews said there was definitely some energy and its a good division win injuries ravens wr  left the game

to an improbable victory in baltimore gay capped a terrific day with a 53 yard field goal in overtime giving the colts a 22 19 win over the ravens on sunday gay made a record four kicks from beyond 50 yards including a 53 yarder that tied it in the final minute of regulation his chance in overtime didnt come until after both teams had been stopped on fourth down near midfield i was in a pretty good groove that point in time gay said was really just kind of in that blackout mode where i wasnt thinking too much the ravens 2 1 wasted two overtime chances with great field position they took over at the indianapolis 48 after a punt and went three and out then baltimore swarmed on fourth and 1 from the baltimore 46 stopping the indianapolis running back and taking over the ball with 410 remaining but the colts forced the ravens into a fourth and 3 situation at the indy 47 and threw incomplete as baltimore called in vain for a penalty on linebacker  who appeared to impede receiver going over the middle there was no flag and the colts 2 1 were able to drive in position for gays fifth field goal of the game with 109 remaining jackson smiled and hesitated before commenting on his last throw to flowers we had plenty of opportunities in the game to finish but it is what it is jackson said fight another day  playing in place of injured rookie  threw for 227 yards and a touchdown for the colts moss ran for 122 yards on 30 carries jackson ran for 101 yards and two tds tucker the baltimore star who two years ago set a record with a 66 yard field goal to win a game at detroit came up short from 61 with 1 second left in regulation so the game went to overtime i have nothing but respect for justin tucker hes arguably the greatest of all time gay said to have that percentage at 10 11 years is nothing but amazing it didnt seem like a great day for kicking thanks to the remnants of tropical storm ophelia there was significant rain before the game although conditions seemed to improve as the day progressed and the wind didnt look like a huge factor it was a little bit more drama leading up to it because you hear oh its going to be pouring rain its supposed to be windy gay said youre preparing for that way but i try not to look too much into it you never know what youre going to get until you get here tucker made a 50 yard field goal with 733 remaining in the fourth quarter to give the ravens a one point lead and a late punt by pinned the colts on their 2 with 214 left on third and long minshew accidentally stepped out of the back of the end zone for a safety while under heavy pressure that made it 19 16 but after a fair catch on the ensuing free kick baltimore started its drive with 203 on the clock and thanks to the two minute warning their last remaining timeout and a baltimore penalty the colts got the ball back with 141 left they drove into range for gay to tie it with 57 seconds remaining he was on fire coach shane steichen said safety had three sacks for the ravens all in the first half jackson threw for 202 yards jackson completed all seven of his first half passes and his first 10 overall and the ravens looked on their way to an easy win at first the star quarterback opened the scoring with in the first quarter and baltimore was on the move again before practice squad call up fumbled at the end of a 24 yard reception then the indianapolis defensive front began imposing its will a bit jackson fumbled and had to fall on the ball at his 8 on one third down play the colts took the ensuing punt and tied the game when minshew found moss for  jackson fumbled again inside his 20 and this time indianapolis recovered and kicked a field goal the ravens had four first half fumbles losing two the colts led 13 7 in the third quarter before jackson scored on a 10 yard draw to put baltimore ahead gay gave indianapolis the lead in the fourth with a 53 yard kick but tucker answered for the ravens cat and mouse gays first field goal of the game was much shorter but included some intrigue on fourth and goal from the 7 the colts lined up as if to go for it and the ravens called timeout then indy sent in the field goal team only to have the offense then rush on in a mass substitution but that meant baltimore had to have a chance to sub too and the ravens did that slowly enough that the play clock ran out and the colts were called for delay of game gay then made a 31 yard kick that put indianapolis up 10 7 injuries baltimore had several key players out for this game including receiver  ankle cornerback foot and two starters on the offensive line linebacker left with an early ankle injury and running back was evaluated for a concussion up next colts host the next sunday ravens visit the on sunday ap nfl

offensive ineptitude the last a from to with 117 to go that helped the steelers rally to an improbable 17 10 victory we found a way to win down the stretch pickett said i think thats all that matters you know were nowhere near as good as we need to be not even close yet it didnt matter not with the ravens 3 2 intent on giving the game away baltimore turned it over three times allowed that sparked pittsburghs late surge and squandered a handful of other opportunities to bury the steelers 3 2 the last coming when s lob to the end zone to with 410 to go ended up in the hands of a son of former steeler linebacker and coach joey porter sr pickett whose erratic play over the opening month of the season has offered little proof hes ready to in his first full year as the starter gathered himself enough to drive the steelers 80 yards in eight plays the last coming when pickens beat veteran ravens cornerback and fellow hoover ala high alum down the sideline to give pittsburgh its first touchdown in nine quarters and help the steelers put a the previous week firmly in the rearview mirror the resiliency from the game we just played was incredible said pickens who caught six passes for 130 yards baltimore certainly helped the ravens dropped a handful of passes including two in the end zone and turned it over three times including twice in the last five minutes to lose a game they seemingly had under control from the opening coin toss they came out and played their game and ended up getting one flowers said but we let them take that one picketts  progress picketts game winning drive will help ease  momentarily anyway  some of the heat surrounding the offense and  while early game issues remain very much a problem the steelers did manage 201 yards and scored three times in the second half pickett completed 18 of 32 for 242 yards and the touchdown struggling with his accuracy except when throwing the ball up to the 6 foot 4 pickens while the chants of fire canada popped up at times by the end they were replaced by a collective roar  and maybe an exhale or two in the coachs box  as pickett put together a game winning drive in the final minutes with the ravens you get to this level theres so many outside factors that try to get into a team and try to pull a team apart whether its media related fan related whatever it may be pickett said you have to stay together because its the ultimate team game jumping on jackson jackson appeared on the verge of a breakout against the steelers a team he has struggled against since entering the league in 2018 he had a 26 yard run early and found open receivers while moving the ball with ease early it didnt last the ravens mustered just 91 yards after halftime and allowed four sacks including a strip sack by with 102 remaining that led to s third field goal jackson finished 22 of 38 for 236 yards and the late interception and 45 yards rushing while falling to 2 4 in his career against pittsburgh we had the steelers beat jackson said on offense we had to find our groove we didnt find it the defense played a great game  kept stopping kept giving us opportunities weve just got to do what we do and finish drives costly mistake baltimore was up 10 3 and driving late in the first half when it faced fourth and 2 at the pittsburgh 23 with the clock ticking rather than have come on for a very makeable field goal ravens center snapped the ball to a surprised jackson who rolled to his right and threw the ball away the original plan was to kick but linderbaum thought he saw one of the steelers jump into the neutral zone and started the play expecting a penalty that would have resulted in baltimore a first down instead the ravens ended up with nothing it was my fault not being aware and putting our team

lopsided from the start jackson threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns finishing with a near perfect passer rating of 1558 he also ran for a td today was lights out said tight end  who caught two td passes i think just by lamar obviously coach monk from the top down on the offensive side of the ball those two guys were elite baltimore 5 2 scored on its first four possessions against the nfc north leading lions 5 2 it was the most complete performance of the season by the ravens and a resurgent detroit squad fell flat while facing a major test on the road we just didnt play well i hate to say it its just one of those games we could not get out of our own way lions coach dan campbell said its a credit to those guys they played outstanding football and rubbed our nose in it jackson went 21 of 27 hes completed at least 70 of his passes in every game but one this season but the ravens had still been pretty inconsistent offensively until sunday monken was hired in the offseason and when baltimore with jackson on a new contract there was plenty of excitement about their partnership now its easy to see why jackson had great success with deep passes against detroit often finding open receivers with plenty of room to run baltimore protected him well and when that started to break down his scrambling kept plays going jackson opened the scoring with a 7 yard bootleg on fourth and 1 on his teams next possession he escaped the pocket to the right and long enough to find for  an 11 yard td pass to andrews made it 21 0 and then scored on a 2 yard run at that point the lions had only managed three three and outs baltimore had a 28 0 lead a 16 0 edge in first downs and a 325 13 advantage in total yards detroit drove all the way to the baltimore 6 to start the second half but turned the ball over on downs the ravens needed only four plays to go almost the entire length of the field edwards was so open for a short pass that he rumbled for an 80 yard gain and jacksons 8 yard scoring toss to andrews gave the afc north leaders a 35 0 advantage detroit finally scored early in the fourth quarter on a 21 yard run by rookie  baltimore has allowed a league low seven touchdowns

just knew that they havent faced a defense this year like ours the lions had won four straight  all by at least 14 points  and theyd scored at least 20 points in 15 consecutive games but they were no match for the ravens on either side of the ball and baltimore had put backup quarterback in the game by the end  who was drafted by detroit back in 2014 had two of baltimores five sacks of the ravens contributed his fourth interception of the season chunk plays the ravens had eight passing plays of at least 20 yards only one team  the with nine against minnesota  has had more in a game this season

deadline pass without adding a running back then they unleashed on an unsuspecting seattle squad it turned out ok right coach john harbaugh said even harbaugh would have been hard pressed to predict this type of breakout for mitchell a 5 foot 8 undrafted rookie from east carolina who had no nfl carries before sunday he ran for 138 yards and his first pro touchdown to help the ravens beat the seahawks 37 3  added his first td since the super bowl two seasons ago as baltimore routed a first place team for the second time in three weeks ran for two touchdowns for the ravens 7 2 who remained tied for the best record in the afc after holding an opponent to nine points or fewer for the fourth time this season threw for 187 yards and ran for 60 before sitting out the fourth quarter he also improved to 18 1 as a starter against nfc teams the past three weeks in particular baltimore has built a compelling case it might be the best team in the nfl the ravens 38 6 then won in routine fashion at lowly arizona before dominating a seattle team that remained tied atop the nfc west despite the loss the seahawks 5 3 managed only six first downs and were outgained 515 151 we couldnt tackle in the second half we just didnt tackle seattle coach pete carroll said its just basic plays and we didnt get them on the ground thats the part i need to look at the most thats what im the most concerned about jackson was a bit gimpy after being tackled on a play in the third but remained in the game baltimore had little reason to leave him in during the final quarter and guided a touchdown drive of his own both teams turned the ball over twice in the first half but those giveaways didnt lead to many points edwards opened the scoring with a 4 yard run in the second quarter then intercepted his sixth pass of the season but the ravens gave the ball back when jackson lost a fumble after forcing a punt baltimore drove 84 yards in 10 plays and went up 14 0 on a 3 yard run by edwards after seattle got a field goal the seahawks had a great chance to cut into the lead further when a fumble by beckham gave them the ball at baltimores 43 but sacked smith on back to back plays the second of which resulted in a fumble that gave the ravens the ball at the seattle 36 with 33 seconds left in the half s field goal made it 17 3 when the defense gives you those opportunities and you kind of have a chance to steal some momentum right there youve got to capitalize smith said we didnt we turned the ball right back over and gave them points the ravens entered the game with a league high 31 sacks and added to that total with four before halftime mitchell had played in only two previous games for the ravens  without carrying the ball a single time he made the most of his nine carries against seattle scoring on a 40 yard run in the third and adding in the fourth when im on the sideline just looking at everybody else seeing how they play seeing the o line was just giving us the holes that we needed and opportunities mitchell said when i came in i just took advantage the seahawks didnt appear ready to deal with mitchells speed and ability to find holes he came in and did great today he ran the ball very hard said seattle nose tackle said adding that the seahawks were honing in on edwards and  mitchell came in with some explosive runs mitchells father anthony was also an undrafted free agent he caught on with the ravens in 2000 and returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown in a playoff win at tennessee during baltimores run to a super bowl title harbaugh said keaton mitchells presence didnt factor into the teams  the ravens lost running back to an achilles tendon injury in the season opener but with a great running quarterback in jackson plus edwards hill and now mitchell they remain one of the leagues top rushing teams baltimore outrushed seattle 298 28 and had the ball for 4004 beckham caught a touchdown pass for the in the super bowl in february 2022 but he also injured his knee in that game and didnt play again until this season with baltimore his 6 yard td catch from huntley made it 37 3 its been a long journey for me said beckham who turned 31 on sunday tough days dark days hard days some good in there it was seattles most lopsided loss since a 42 7 defeat against the rams in 2017 it might have been worse but the ravens took a knee on fourth down at seattles 6 with under a minute remaining quite an impact the 32 year old van noy didnt sign with the ravens until late september he already has five sacks in six

baltimore showed why they were so desperate to acquire the star quarterback watson completed every pass he threw after halftime and cleveland made all the important plays down the stretch rallying from a 14 point fourth quarter deficit to beat the ravens 33 31 on sunday made a 40 yard field goal on the final play to win it big win on the road against a very very good team  one of the top teams in the league one of the best defenses in the league watson said i think it was overall a great opportunity not just for me but the whole offense  but this team too cleveland 6 3 trailed 31 17 before watson threw a 10 yard touchdown pass to with 857 remaining then one of lamar jacksons passes caromed high into the air and was picked off by  and he returned the interception 34 yards for a td just 41 seconds later the ravens stayed ahead 31 30 because hopkins missed the extra point but cleveland got the ball back and drove 58 yards for the winning kick the key play was a 17 yard pass to on second and 19 that got the drive back on track the browns had edges in rushing 178 106 and time of possession 3415 2545 and by the end baltimores stout defense couldnt protect the lead thats something that would have been very valuable in this game to stop the run better and you get the run game going just a little bit better ravens coach john harbaugh said but we werent able to do it we tried but we werent able to cleveland traded quite a few draft picks to acquire watson before last season and gave him a 230 million fully guaranteed contract he was suspended 11 games last season for violating the nfls personal conduct policy after being accused by more than two dozen women of sexual assault and sexual misconduct during massage therapy sessions the browns went 7 10 this season watson has been bothered by shoulder problems and missed three games and the browns owe much of their success to an excellent defense but after trailing 17 9 at halftime in baltimore the multidimensional qb went 14 for 14 the rest of the way he finished with 213 yards passing and 37 rushing and his elusiveness was an issue for the ravens vaunted pass rush hes a warrior he battled through an ankle injury in the second half cleveland coach kevin stefanski said baltimore 7 3 had a four game winning streak snapped and the victory by cleveland tightened the race in the afc north significantly despite the high score the defenses  ranked no 1 and 2 in the league entering the game  had their moments on the second play from scrimmage watsons pass was batted into the air by  and the ball came right down to the baltimore safety who returned the interception 18 yards for a td 40 seconds into the game  an undrafted rookie who had no nfl carries before rushing for 138 yards on nine attempts against seattle scored on a 39 yard run on his first touch against the browns that gave baltimore a 14 0 lead less than five minutes in  who played for cleveland from 2019 until in 2021 caught a pass over the middle from jackson and outran everyone for a 40 yard touchdown that gave the ravens a 24 9 lead in the third but after that baltimores defense couldnt get off the field the browns went 75 yards on 17 plays and capped the drive  which lasted more than 10 minutes  with a 3 yard td run by  watson ran for a 2 point conversion that made it 24 17 the browns were about to get the ball back when ex raven james proche committed what seemed like a devastating gaffe fumbling a punt to gift baltimore possession at the cleveland 12 the ensuing drive was anything but simple despite the short field a holding call on the browns on third down kept it going then baltimore had a touchdown called back for holding jackson appeared to have thrown an interception in the end zone but another holding call on cleveland negated that finally scored on a 1 yard run to make it 31 17 it was far from over these guys are tough but down the stretch things start to slow down and guys kind of settled into things and we played the way we had practiced cleveland defensive end said we made the plays we needed to make the browns not only pulled within a half game of the ravens in the standings they also avoided a series sweep after to baltimore earlier this season when watson was hurt under pressure jackson and watson certainly had their mobility put to the test baltimore had four sacks including two by ex brown  cleveland had three including 1 12 by garrett garrett now has 11 sacks on the season he joined reggie white john randle demarcus ware jared allen bruce smith and lawrence taylor as the only players to have six consecutive seasons with at least 10 sacks injuries it was a bruising game between division rivals cleveland was without both starting tackles from the outset browns cb left with a neck injury and s

going forward the injuries overshadowed this huge divisional matchup but only to a degree it was a huge win for a baltimore team that has been dominant at times but hasnt been able to pull away in the

waiting for wide receiver to have a breakout game on sunday night the rookie finally seized his opportunity on a national stage flowers had a touchdown catch and ran for a game sealing score late in the fourth quarter as the afc best ravens beat the 20 10 on sunday night ive been waiting for him to score multiple tds in a game having that last one with the run was nice said jackson about flowers who was the 22nd overall pick in aprils draft flowers wasnt the only one who came through for the ravens 9 3 who head into the bye week one half game ahead of kansas city jacksonville and miami for the best record in the conference baltimore forced four turnovers while the offense was balanced with 197 yards rushing and 177 passing jackson completed 18 of 32 passes and ran for 39 on 11 carries becoming the fourth quarterback in nfl history to exceed 5000 rushing yards our defense was playing lights out all night i feel like if we can keep our offense balanced we can put points on the board jackson said the chargers largely bottled up jackson and the ravens offense in the second half but flowers put the game away when he took an end around on third and 2 and with 136 left i thought the fourth quarter was a statement we put an exclamation point on it with our defense getting the stops and offense finishing it at the end there coach john harbaugh said flowers when he caught a 3 yard pass in the back of the end zone on a crossing route to give the ravens a 7 3 lead the chargers came into the game tied for league low with eight giveaways their four turnovers were the most since they had that many in a week 3 loss to carolina in 2020 that was certainly the difference in the game and it usually is in the nfl coach brandon staley said we hung in there about as well as you could turning it over like that and one of them in the red area just didnt play well enough clean enough to win tonight was 29 of 44 for 217 yards with a touchdown and an interception for the chargers 4 7 who have lost three straight and are last in the afc west had 14 receptions for 106 yards i dont think that we executed the way that we would have liked to have herbert said i have to be able to get the ball out quicker i have to make some checks it wasnt good enough on our part today with 832 remaining in the fourth quarter pulled los angeles within 13 10 the tight end caught the ball at the 1 and then outmuscled ravens safety  the chargers had a chance to possibly send it into overtime after missed a 44 yard field goal attempt with 257 remaining they took over at their own 34 and drove to the ravens 46 but they turned it over on downs when herbert was pressured in the pocket and was called for intentional grounding on fourth down record book jackson joined michael vick cam newton and as the only quarterbacks in the 5000 yard rushing club on an 8 yard keeper in the third quarter the sixth year pro though is the fastest by far to do it jackson has played 82 games 22 fewer than it took vick to reach the milestone all for naught los angeles had a 19 play drive that took up nearly nine minutes of the second half but it came away empty on third and 14 from the baltimore 16 ravens defensive end strip sacked herbert and recovered the ball at the 23 it was a defensive game so those turnovers definitely helped us out a lot cornerback said if we can get three or more then you have a good chance of winning the game so we did that for sure today and it paid off the possession when allen caught a 3 yard pass from herbert and then lateraled to  who took it 14 yards to the ravens 39 that was some boise state stuff from chargers offensive coordinator kellen moore said ravens linebacker  who was with the chargers last season striking first the chargers got the ball first and took a

and kept running im like i cant go down right here i made it this far wallace said in his first game returning punts as a pro wallace 76 yards for a touchdown in overtime to lift the ravens to over los angeles on sunday snapping the rams three game winning streak wallace became the fourth player in nfl history to score a touchdown on a punt return in ot of the this season on sept 11 against buffalo it just feels great to be able to make a difference in the game and help the team win wallace said you could say a once in a lifetime moment the 24 year old wallace is in his third season after being drafted in the fourth round in 2021 hes managed only six receptions in his career plus a couple of kickoff returns as a rookie when  baltimores top return man left with back problems sunday wallace was pressed into duty he returned three punts in the game and his final one more than made up for a crucial penalty he committed in the second quarter that led to points for los angeles

narrowly missed picking up a huge win on the road give the ravens credit for finding a way los angeles coach sean mcvay said there were some opportunities but we made a lot of plays to stay in that game and there will be some opportunities for us as a team jolly had the last real chance to bring wallace down and after he couldnt quite do it the baltimore returner punctuated the winning touchdown with a leap into the end zone before the ravens mobbed him in the corner it was mountains and valleys it was peaks and there was lows in that game baltimore coach john harbaugh said national football league in december against a very very good opponent our guys just weather all those storms figuratively and literally out there catching passes and punts was an adventure on a rainy day in baltimore but and threw three touchdown passes apiece jackson passed for 316 yards and stafford for 294 each offense went three and out in overtime before the final los angeles punt just continue to trust the work weve put in stafford said obviously didnt get the outcome we wanted but we battled all three phases had positive things and things we can be better at jacksons 21 yard touchdown strike to with

nfl was a statement game and the delivered a loud one to the rest of the league jackson threw two touchdown passes in a span of 18 seconds in the third quarter and the ravens intercepted four times in a 33 19 victory over the on monday night our guys work hard they compete hard everybody wants to be respected coach john harbaugh said theres one way to be respected and thats to go out there and earn that jackson and the ravens 12 3 turned a between the top two teams in the nfl into a lopsided win with strong performances on both sides of the ball and the defense set the tone early by intercepting purdy on three of the first four drives of the game for the 49ers 11 4 before jackson started to take over he scrambled 30 yards to set up a field goal on the final play of the first half to give the ravens a 16 12 lead and then helped put the game away early in the third quarter after baltimore forced a punt on the opening drive of the second half jackson capped a drive by throwing a 6 yard touchdown pass to  purdy then was intercepted by on the next play from scrimmage jackson immediately turned that into another score with a 9 yard td pass to that made it 30 12 i thought lamar had an mvp performance tonight harbaugh said it takes a team to create a performance like that but it takes a player to play at that level to play at an mvp level it takes a player to play that way lamar was all over the field jackson threw for 252 yards ran for 45 more and vaulted past purdy to become the mvp favorite according to  his only real mishap came when he got called for intentional grounding in the end zone after nearly tripping over the umpire leading to a safety in the first quarter we got the w jackson said i dont really care about performance i just want to win thats what happened tonight on christmas i got my gift purdy had his roughest game as a pro becoming the first 49ers quarterback to throw four interceptions in a game since colin kaepernick in 2015 adding a few more near interceptions and being unable to generate the big plays that made him the leagues most efficient quarterback coming into the game purdy finished 18 for 32 for 255 yards before getting replaced by after getting a stinger in the fourth quarter i didnt mind his demeanor coach kyle shanahan said about purdy he stayed in there and kept battling our whole team struggled there in the second half so it wasnt just him san franciscos fared far better with running back running for 102 yards and a td and adding 28 yards receiving he set a franchise record with his eighth straight game with at least 100 yards from scrimmage this marquee matchup marked the second time ever that the teams with sole possession of the best record in each conference played in week 16 or later both teams remain on top of their conferences the niners are in a three way tie with philadelphia and detroit for the best record in the nfc and can still clinch the no 1 seed and a first round bye with wins in their final two games the mindset is we cant let one turn into two linebacker said weve got to wipe this one learn from it of course watch the tape hard be honest with yourself but weve got to get right back to work we cant let this affect our confidence as a team we know who we are the ravens remained a game ahead of miami for the best record in the afc and can clinch the no 1 seed with a win next week against the dolphins baltimore improved to 6 1 this season against teams currently in playoff positioning outscoring them by 164 points per game we play a brand of football that people dont want to

fans made their views on the topic clear serenaded throughout by mvp chants jackson threw for 321 yards and five touchdowns as the ravens eviscerated the 56 19 on sunday baltimore won its first afc north title since 2019 when jackson was named mvp he might be closing in on that honor again he played a perfect football game in terms of the passing game coach john harbaugh said the stat sheet agreed jackson went 18 of 21 without an interception he finished with a perfect passer rating of 1583 jackson missed the end of the past two baltimore seasons because of injuries now the ravens can rest him voluntarily next week if they want although harbaugh was noncommittal on that baltimore 13 3 has won six straight and the ravens rolled through a grueling december stretch that included games against the rams jaguars 49ers and dolphins i dont know if ive seen a more impressive performance in a game im not sure ive seen a more impressive performance in a season to date said harbaugh whose team will have a first round bye before hosting its postseason opener obviously we have a lot more to do weve got a lot of work to do in front of us but this is a mature football team miami 11 5 is also postseason bound but now the winner of next weekends dolphins bills game will take the afc east miami was without two offensive stars in receiver ankle and running back knee ankle and now the dolphins face another potentially significant injury linebacker  with his team down 30 points  had to be carted off with 305 remaining after hurting his knee that raised obvious questions about why chubb was still in the game theres times like this one where i would like a time machine for sure miami coach mike mcdaniel said jackson had more touchdown passes than incompletions thats a feat miamis also accomplished in over denver in week 3 jackson also had a perfect passer rating against miami in 2019 he joins tom brady against detroit as the only quarterbacks with two perfect ratings against the same team with a minimum of 20 attempts i love the guy ravens linebacker said he proved everything he had to prove if anybody else saying otherwise they just dont like lamar thats what it is they dont like us they dont like baltimore they dont like lamar this matchup featured miamis top ranked scoring offense and baltimores top ranked scoring defense in the early going the dolphins had the upper hand they scored on the games first drive when tagovailoa threw an 8 yard pass to  jackson answered with a 20 yard scoring strike to  miami would have had another touchdown on its second drive but bobbled the ball in the end zone and the dolphins kicked a field goal the ravens took the lead for good in the second quarter when capped an 89 yard drive with a 1 yard scoring run after another miami field goal jackson immediately found open deep for a 75 yard touchdown that made it 21 13 the ravens struck again 94 seconds later thanks to a pair of one handed catches the first was an interception by  the second a by on fourth and 7 justice hill returned the second half kickoff 78 yards setting up jacksons 7 yard td toss to likely that made it 35 13 miami trailed 35 14 with under 13 minutes remaining last season before rallying to over the ravens the dolphins started the fourth quarter with a touchdown this time a 1 yard pass from tagovailoa to  but it was baltimore that closed strong last year the score was looking like that at halftime and third quarter then those guys started making plays and we didnt do anything jackson said the only thing that was on my mind was to finish the game and today we did it the ravens marched right back down the field and scored on jacksons 4 yard pass to to go up 42 19 added a 7 yard touchdown run and a miami fumble led to a another td threw a scoring pass to on third and goal from the 19 that was huntleys only pass attempt he also finished with a perfect 1583 passer rating well look at the film tomorrow see what we can do better and move on to the bills tagovailoa said everything is still in front of us for what we want to accomplish as a team streaks and milestones the ravens rushed for at least 100 yards for a 32nd consecutive game and had a sack for a 37th straight  jackson reached 800 yards rushing on the season becoming the first quarterback in nfl history to do that three times  this was the second highest scoring total in franchise history for the ravens behind only their 59 10 win at miami in that 2019 romp  tyreek hill surpassed 10000 yards receiving for his career injuries the teams werent

plenty of running by the time he reached the end zone in the fourth quarter apparently he still had quite a bit of energy leaping past the photographers and disappearing into the tunnel in a celebration that seemed cathartic for the all pro quarterback jackson threw two touchdown passes and ran for two scores and the pulled away in the second half for a 34 10 win over the on saturday to advance to the afc championship game it was only the second victory in five playoff games for jackson a fact he was well aware of you know i heard that he said i dont even got to hear it i see it but it is what it is i really dont care about what people say  those guys just had our teams number in the past but its a different team jackson made some more history saturday becoming the first quarterback since at least 1948  in the regular season or playoffs  with at least two touchdown passes two td runs 100 yards rushing and a 100 passer rating in the same game credit to lamar texans coach demeco ryans said he made a ton of great plays thats why hes the mvp the ravens 14 4 dominated the second half after the teams finished the second quarter tied at 10 jackson said he did most of the talking at halftime a lot of cursing he said jacksons put baltimore ahead to stay although had a solid composed first half for houston the texans 11 8 ultimately couldnt turn enough promising drives into points against an impressive ravens defense now baltimore will host the afc title game for the first time since january 1971 when the colts beat the oakland raiders on their way to a super bowl championship the ravens will play in that semifinal round for the fifth time since their arrival in baltimore theyll take on the winner of between buffalo and kansas city our fans are going to get a chance to cheer just as loud or louder than they did in this game and they were amazing ravens coach john harbaugh said i thought our fans were incredible man it was deafening out there harbaughs brother jim was on hand for the game returning the favor after john went to watch jim coach michigan to earlier this month ravens fans have been haunted by what happened in the playoffs four years ago when baltimore went 14 2 in the regular season but dropped its postseason opener to tennessee houston did enough to create some anxiety especially when returned a punt for a touchdown and jackson struggled at times with the blitzing texans defense but on the first possession of the second half jackson guided baltimore 55 yards in six plays and scored on a run up the middle then a 15 yard touchdown pass to early in the fourth made it 24 10 jacksons final touchdown came on with 620 to play and the fired up quarterback kept running right into the tunnel in that corner of the field sims return was the only td for the texans whose offense never did reach the end zone in 120 minutes against the ravens this season houston in its season opener at baltimore jackson rushed for 821 yards during the regular season which is a big part of the case for his second mvp award but he surpassed 100 yards on the ground only once he ran for exactly 100 on saturday on 11 attempts a 14 yard bootleg on fourth and 1 near midfield led to the touchdown by likely that gave the ravens some breathing room jackson also passed for 152 yards lamar is a dog ive been a fan of his since high school stroud said its really an honor to share the field with a player like that stroud threw for 175 yards and didnt take a sack against a tough baltimore defensive front but the texans dropped to 0 5 in the divisional round of the playoffs theyre the only current franchise that hasnt reached a conference championship game the ravens led the nfl in sacks this season but it was jackson who was under pressure in the first half when houston got to him three times two of those sacks came back to back in the final minute of the second quarter after a missed field goal gave baltimore decent field position penalties held the texans back all day  they ended up with 11 for 70 yards after opened the scoring for baltimore with a 53 yard field goal houston appeared headed for points of its own before two false starts and an intentional grounding flag pushed the texans out of range houston did eventually tie it on a 50 yard field goal by kaimi fairbairn but the ravens answered with a 76 yard march capped by jacksons 3 yard touchdown pass to  down 10 3 the texans struck back on special teams sims who was signed from the practice squad to the active roster earlier in the week broke free up the middle for a 67 yard touchdown adjustments according to the nfls next gen stats jackson faced a career high blitz rate of 75 and went 13 of 18 for 120 yards and two touchdowns against the blitz he got rid of the ball in an average of 225 seconds in the second half compared to 351 in the first one dimensional the ravens outrushed houston 229 38 and eventually the texans lack of any real ground attack caught up with them  even though they avoided any sacks and turnovers on the day up next texans houstons rise this season included an afc south title and a against cleveland the future looks bright with stroud at quarterback ravens baltimore is one win away from its first super bowl appearance in 11 years the ravens did not face the bills or chiefs during the regular season ap nfl "},

kelce said emphatically after all the moments this season when they looked disjointed and vulnerable the chiefs are headed back to the super bowl for the fourth time in five years mahomes and kelce

kelce caught 11 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown and now the big question at next months super bowl in las vegas is whether his girlfriend taylor swift will be able to make it there in the middle of her tour the pop star again sunday and it was for the 34 year old kelce who surpassed jerry rices career record for postseason receptions kansas city 14 6 will face san francisco on feb 11 and a victory would make the chiefs the first team to win it all in back to back seasons since the 19 years ago swifts presence has turned the chiefs into even more of a glamour team than they already were but its been more of a blue collar performance on the field this season aside from kelce mahomes playmakers havent been as threatening as in years past only once this season has kansas city scored more than 31 points and a home loss on christmas to the  on the same day baltimore made a statement with a win at san francisco  seemed to indicate that the chiefs days atop the afc were numbered not so fast playing on the road in the playoffs for the first time with mahomes the chiefs and baltimore in back to back weeks to win the conference ive never doubted no coach andy reid said thats not how we roll the chiefs led 17 7 at halftime and s 43 yard field goal with 234 to play was the only scoring of the second half baltimore kicked deep after that and on third and 9 mahomes connected with valdes scantling who held on and knew exactly what that catch meant were going to the super bowl he said that was it i knew we needed one first down to get us to the goal and they trusted me to go get one mahomes went 30 of 39 for 241 yards and a touchdown jackson could win his second mvp after leading baltimore to the leagues best record and point differential during the regular season but the ravens allowed touchdowns on the first two kansas city possessions and appeared a bit panicky at times after that baltimore 14 5 made undisciplined mistakes all game while kansas city looked the part of the team making its sixth straight appearance in the conference title game with the ravens down by 10 in the third quarter rookie caught a 54 yard pass to the kansas city 10  then was flagged for taunting after the play moments later he fumbled near the goal line and the ravens ended up with no points that was one of several frustrating moments for baltimore fans whose city was hosting an afc championship game since january 1971 when the colts beat the oakland raiders jackson went 20 of 37 for 272 yards and a touchdown but baltimore never really exploited its perceived advantage on the ground jackson raced under one of his own tipped passes in the first half for  but he also turned the ball over twice including a forced pass into heavy coverage that was picked off in the end zone with 645 left in the game once it was clear defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo had the upper hand against the baltimore offense mahomes was happy to manage the game and avoid doing anything too risky spags it seems like when the games get bigger when the challenges get higher he performs even better mahomes said jackson fell to 2 4 as a starter in the postseason despite having been the top seed in the afc twice he made a few sensational individual plays but the ravens had trouble moving the ball otherwise that guy was the main guy i was playing for honestly ravens linebacker said so much stuff he gets that he doesnt deserve this was his opportunity to be able to write some of that stuff off and move on to the next thing thats why it hurts because you want to see people like that teammates that you love and care about get what theyre supposed to get mahomes meanwhile completed his first 11 pass attempts and although the ravens largely shut kansas city down after that the damage was done on a rainy day in baltimore there was some chippy behavior before the game which included ravens defensive back and a group of kansas city players having to be separated then the chiefs forced a three and out on the games first drive and went 86 yards for the opening touchdown kelce caught a 13 yard pass from mahomes over the middle on fourth and 2 then the star tight end beat all pro safety for to make it 7 0 jackson answered in his own spectacular way he broke free for a 21 yard run when baltimore went for it on fourth and 1 from its 34 then the star quarterback ducked out of a near sack by  retreated a bit farther back and threw to flowers who celebrated with teammates by doing the swag surf dance that swift and chiefs fans did at a recent game kansas city was unbothered mahomes drove his team 75 yards in 902  with the help of an acrobatic diving catch by kelce on one third down toss  and capped the 16 play march with a 2 yard touchdown run the chiefs actually missed chances to extend their lead a sack by forced a fumble by jackson that gave kansas city the ball at the baltimore 33 but kelce was marked just short on a third down catch and pacheco was stopped on the ensuing fourth down at the 13 after a couple of personal fouls on baltimore helped kansas city cross midfield late in the half the chiefs were flagged for back to back holding calls the second of which wiped out a 33 yard screen pass to that would have been a touchdown a 9 yard pass to kelce put kansas city in position for harrison butkers 52 yard field goal that made it 17 7

steelers 2 0 scored just one offensive touchdown longer than 25 yards last season theyve produced four of them through two exhibition games three of them coming with pickett on the field its good to see all the hard work kind of pay off in games pickett said obviously its preseason but you know we put a lot of time together so you want to come out here and put points up and thats what were doing the bills 1 1 were not quite as crisp in safety s return to his hometown the pittsburgh native received a warm ovation and exchanged hugs with several steelers  including pickett a college teammate of hamlins at pitt  during the opening coin toss hamlin had three tackles in the first half as he from on the field in cincinnati in january it was super special hamlin said of being asked to go out for the coin toss a surprise coach sean mcdermott laid on him at the last minute made me feel like a big kid the good vibes of hamlins return aside the bills showed theres still plenty to work on before visiting the on sept 11 completed 7 of 10 passes in what could be his lone preseason appearance but failed to lead buffalo to any points during his three series the bills did reach pittsburgh territory on its second drive before penalties on three consecutive snaps pushed them out of scoring position symbolic of a night when they were flagged 13 times and didnt score until players who may not stick around when rosters are trimmed to 53 on aug 29 mcdermott called the penalties unacceptable particularly since they were a point of emphasis after the bills were penalized eight times in

the few bright spots for buffalo backup quarterback threw three interceptions including a lob that pittsburgh second round pick cornerback  hauled in to set up a touchdown pass from to in the waning seconds of the first half to extend the lead to 21 0 its clear were not where we need to be right now mcdermott said the steelers by comparison look ready for their sept 10 opener against san francisco pickett has played three series so far in the preseason each series has ended with pittsburgh reaching the end zone with all three touchdowns coming from at least 25 yards out i like that were getting in some splash steelers coach mike tomlin said though he cautioned its been in a limited sample size maybe though for a team that finished 26th in points scored in 2022 and often needed extended drives to find the end zone the early returns of what may be possible in 2023 are promising we want to be a team capable of big plays warren said its something weve been working toward all

a a a self motivated allen let loose with a near perfect performance in leading the bills to a 38 10 rout of the on sunday i love feeling how i felt last week i really do because it makes the good feel that much better allen said i take the bad with the good i understand it and im just trying to let it fuel me and use it to my benefit allen threw three touchdown passes in a game he opened by completing his first 13 attempts putting aside the over aggressive tendencies that got him into trouble against the jets allen established a rhythm by focusing on completing mostly short and easy attempts to finish 31 of 37 for 274 yards and no turnovers it was allens 21st outing with three or more touchdowns passing and buffalo improved to 13 4 in games following a loss since 2019 just us getting back to who we feel like we are allen said buffalo finished with 183 yards rushing with allen accounting for just 7 led the way with a career best 123 yards  the most by a bills running back since had 156 in december 2017 what stood out was allen playing within his limitations center referred to the outing as stoic and intentional i think it represents his tenacity as a competitor and also that he understands who he is morse said its a beautiful thing and it was just awesome to see and be a part of this week especially josh going out there and finding his mojo the raiders had few answers in a game they opened by scoring on davante adams 16 yard touchdown catch less than three minutes in and then found themselves trailing 28 10 before their first possession of the third quarter whatever chance las vegas had to get back into the game ended four plays from scrimmage later when linebacker jumped in front of a to intercept jimmy garoppolos pass at midfield i thought we created some momentum at the beginning of the game but momentum is just a word raiders coach josh mcdaniels said we need to play well and coach well for 60 minutes we cant just live off the momentum of a drive we had five decent plays and then didnt play very well the rest of the game the raiders dropped to 1 1 following an outing in which garoppolo finished 16 of 24 for 185 yards and was intercepted twice and jacobs the nfls leading rusher last year was limited to a career worst minus 2 yards on nine carries  it marked the first time since the nfls merger that the leagues defending rushing champion finished with negative yardage i dont think we need to totally flush it i think we need to address where we went wrong and improve from there jacobs said thats the thing that makes it so frustrating for me is just the potential you see flashes of how good we can really be allen completed passes to nine players with catching six for 92 yards and a touchdown tight end and also caught touchdown passes while and scored a touchdown each rushing also had an interceptiona and recovered zamir whites fumble on what became the raiders final possession closing a week in which the bills faced several off field distractions coach sean mcdermott had to address his leadership group after team owner terry pegula was accused of making racially insensitive comments  pegula denied the allegations and then on wednesday a bills media reporter was overheard on an open microphone questioning receiver stefon diggs character diggs went to social media a day later calling the comments hurtful and insulting i think it shows the resiliency of this team no one liked the taste in the mouth we had this week i think we brought a certain edge to this weeks practice and preparation morse

go unnoticed for teammates on defense who forced five turnovers as buffalo won a second consecutive game since a rough season opening loss it looks like i didnt even play today all white jersey not even dirty said safety  who had one of four interceptions of  the guys up front were just getting after the quarterback it was just awesome to see the bills 2 1 have outscored opponents 75 13 since losing at the in overtime in week 1 this wouldve been a shutout if not for the commanders kicking a 51 yard field goal with 46 seconds left allen threw and ran for a touchdown and never got sacked he was 20 of 32 with 218 yards passing including a 35 yard td pass to  and added a 10 yard scamper into the end zone among his 46 yards rushing its easy to play the game when your defense comes up for you like that and puts you in good situations said allen who criticized himself for an interception on third and 20 that effectively functioned as a long punt our offense did what we had to do but our defense balled out the bills tormented howell sacking him nine times to go with the interceptions by  hyde and and aj epenesa  the last being a pick 6 that sent many commanders fans to the exits they also forced a fumble improving to 19 2 since 2019 when facing a quarterback who has made 16 or fewer nfl starts it was just the sixth time since the super bowl era began in 1966 and first time since 1995 that a defense sacked a qb nine plus times and picked him off four plus times our big thing was just attack attack attack pressure be physical  make them uncomfortable epenesa said thats our comfort zone when were flying around and were playing aggressive like that thats just us as an identity and thats what were trying to establish and keep that going throughout the entire season making his fourth start for the commanders 2 1 howell lost for the first time as a pro with many of the offensive line woes that were masked by wins against arizona and denver finally costing them howell was 19 of 29 for 170 yards we played about as bad as we can play howell said just got to be better s field goal in the final minute helped washington avoid the first shutout of the ron rivera era that began in 2020 it also wouldve been the first time a unit run by eric bieniemy was shut out since he became kansas citys offensive coordinator in 2018 difference making d a 38 10 thrashing of the

wasnt going to be an issue for the slow starting on thursday night after riling up the crowd in the end zone following warmups receiver gave what coach sean mcdermott called an impassioned pregame speech then responded by throwing two touchdown passes and running for another  while shrugging off aggravating an injury to his throwing shoulder  and the bills hung on to beat the 24 18 well i mean i could feel the team they came out with an attitude and it started in the locker room really mcdermott said of buffalos early intensity level stefon diggs theres a little motivational couple of words he said to the team before we went out there thats what a leader does he did a phenomenal job of basically setting the tone diggs finished with nine catches for 70 yards but wasnt always the primary target gabriel davis had a career best nine catches for 87 yards and a touchdown and rookie tight end scored his first career td on a 22 yard catcha in a game the bills never trailed and following a week of questions about  allen came through for the bills 5 3 throwing for 324 yards on 31 of 40 passing he had been listed on the bills report with a right shoulder injury and was checked in the blue medical tent in the second quarter but remained in the game allen was in his comfort zone from the beginning in overseeing a hurry up offense to find a rhythm that had been lacking in buffalos previous three outings he also was unafraid to take off and run with the ball in finishing with 41 yards rushing  his most since a season best 46 in beating washington in week 3 personally i feel like i did but i will let you guys write about that whether you guys thought i did or not allen said on bringing a higher energy level this team moves really well when im able to get the ball around to our playmakers the tempo urgency and throws over the middle the bills offense was criticized for previously lacking all became apparent on an opening drive buffalo settled for kicking a 37 yard field goal after its drive stalled at tampa bays 19 allen was hurt while being sacked on the play before he scored on a 13 yard touchdown scamper early in the second quarter he returned in time for the next series after being examined ill be sore for a couple of days but well be fine he said buffalo limited the buccaneers led attack to less than 200 yards of offense through three quarters and 302 overall and bills punter contributed by landing three punts inside tampa bays 10 mayfield tried to rally tampa bay 3 4 late he threw a followed by a 2 point conversion to  to get the buccaneers within six with 244 remaining but it took tampa bay 17 plays and 721 to march 92 yards for that score from his own 45 fell between several players in the end zone the buccaneers have lost three straight and four of five since opening 2 0 mayfield finished 25 of 42 for 237 yards and two touchdowns including a 3 yarder to  who was the closest to mayfields final throw when it fell to the turf untouched running back led the bucs with seven catches for 70 yards and had nine carries for 39 yards i thought everybody fought their tails off tonight the effort wasnt our problem we hung together we were tough we clawed we scratched we fought our way back in there tampa bay coach todd bowles said we were right there a few plays here or there a few penalties here or there we feel like we can get better from that the buccaneers were flagged 11 times for 74 yards that included offensive lineman picking up an unnecessary roughness call following the 2 point conversion which forced tampa bay to kick off from its own 20 we gave ourselves a chance mayfield said it just shows we are a few plays away we have the fight now we just have to have the execution the buccaneers scored 10 points in a 54 second span to tie the game in the second quarter hit a 57 yard field goal and godwin scored two plays after tampa bay safety  tipped allens pass and the ball was intercepted by defensive lineman  allen responded by leading buffalo on a nine play 75 yard drive capped by the quarterback rolling to his right and throwing across his body to find kincaid open over the middle allens td run was the 43rd of his career matching steve young for second most all time among quarterbacks and he now has 199 combined passing and rushing touchdowns tying hall of famer dan marino for second among quarterbacks in their first six seasons bills receiver sensed a difference in a game he had six catches for a team high 92 yards we just came to this game with a different mindset shakir said obviously ups and downs but mcdermott tells us dont ride the roller coaster stay consistent as a team and stay on the gas pedal up next buccaneers at houston on nov 5 bills at cincinnati on nov 5 last january on the road against

bills on monday night the broncos 4 5 have won three straight and four of six since a 70 20 loss at miami and they came out of their bye week carrying over the momentum of a 24 9 victory over kansas

should be who we can be and who we are going to be the bills 5 5 continue to sink out of the playoff picture having dropped four of six forget defending their afc east title for a fourth consecutive season the bills are suddenly in jeopardy of missing the playoffs altogether for the first time since 2018 yeah im still confident but its no secret the clocks ticking got to have some urgency now quarterback said after throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble the clock might also be ticking on offensive coordinator ken dorseys tenure after the bills failed to score 26 or more points for a sixth straight game its matches buffalos worst stretch since allens rookie season in 2018 im confident but i believe we can be better at the same time coach sean mcdermott said when asked about dorsey and he had few answers on whats required to turn around a team whose offense is sputtering and defense held up for the most part despite missing five starters to injury i think i need a little bit of time here after the game to assess that mcdermott said obviously im not real happy right now so ill evaluate that in the next 24 hours here and see where that takes us mcdermott called the too many men penalty to be inexcusable because its a situation the team practices at least two or three times a week lutz was relieved extremely grateful that we get another opportunity and you dont get that opportunity every day lutz said so huge win just grateful i was able to get another kick there lutz also overcame his own struggles in a game he missed an extra point by hitting the left upright

play of the drive came on third down and 10 from buffalos 45 when wilson  facing an all out blitz  lobbed a pass deep over the middle intended for  who was clearly interfered with by defensive back  johnson was flagged for pass interference giving denver the ball at buffalos 17 after allowing 181 points in going 1 4 in their five outings the broncos have clamped down to allow 67 points in their past four the broncos have 16 takeaways over their past five outings wilson finished 24 of 29 for 193 yards including a perfectly placed a what initially appeared as if wilson was simply throwing the ball out of bounds instead landed in suttons hands with the receiver able to get both feet in bounds the play was initially ruled an incompletion before being overturned upon a replay review the broncos forced four turnovers two weeks after forcing five against the chiefs it just feels so good to win man im sitting here thinking about the adversity that we hit and how everybody kind of answered the bell there safety said of the broncos down then up season youre always going to face adversity its just a matter of how you respond allen has turned the ball over in all but two games and thrown an interception in six straight  the longest run of his career he finished 15 of 26 for 177 yards including a 22 yard touchdown to rookie tight end  the turnover fest began on buffalos first

shouldering the blame of getting his offensive coordinator fired this week by placing an emphasis on injecting a little more energy and joy into his on field performance it showed allen threw three touchdown passes and a once stagnating offense showed signs of regaining its swagger by scoring on six of its first eight possessions in a 32 6 rout of the afc east rival on sunday lets have fun playing this game its football and at the end of the day we get to do in my opinion the most amazing job on the planet  so weve got to enjoy it when you can allen said we were executing at a high level today he added every season man has its ups and downs youre going to have adversity its how you bounce back from the adversity the bills 6 5 snapped a two game skid and topped 25 points for the first time in seven weeks after building a 9 0 lead on three field goals by  allen broke the game open with three touchdowns over four possessions spanning halftime in doing so he extended his streak to 19 games with a td to break the franchise record set by hall of famer jim kelly spanning the 1986 87 seasons the jets 4 6 dropped their third straight and coach robert saleh potentially opened the door for a quarterback switch starter was benched with 217 remaining in the third quarter and replaced by  who didnt fare much better in overseeing an offense that managed to score just its ninth touchdown of the season after spending the past few weeks backing wilson saleh said he was going to watch the tape before making a decision monday well look at all of it im not really answering those questions yet saleh said the bills meantime followed allens energetic lead i love josh what i did tonight is all him just his energy said receiver   tonight it was just nonstop it was fun it felt fun to operate the way we were playing tonight and 17 was the head honcho of all that allen was efficient in finishing 20 of 32 for 275 yards with an interception which came on a desperation hail mary to end the first half otherwise he put the game on ice with a 26 yard touchdown pass to former jets running back on fourth and 1 to cap buffalos opening drive of the third quarter followed with his td to shakir two plays into the bills next possession the 81 yard touchdown was the longest scoring play from scrimmage this season and the offensive outburst came with quarterbacks coach joe brady taking over as coordinator after ken dorsey was fired on tuesday following a 24 22 loss to denver the offense was so charged up it carried over following the game with bills offensive tackle getting into a skirmish with jets defensive lineman michael clemonsa in the tunnel leading to each teams locker room im not a fan of the jets like very disrespectful players is all dawkins would say clemons did not address reporters following the game while teammate said he was attempting to break up the fight a lot of emotions going into it thats it a lot of emotions frustrated the cornerback said i aint have no issues with none of them i was trying to resolve everything the skirmish carried over from the fourth quarter when dawkins continued blocking clemons after the whistle before knocking his opponent down and landing on him a shoving match ensued with dawkins being flagged for unnecessary roughness newly acquired cornerback had two interceptions  buffalos first in seven games   the offensively challenged jets finally scored a touchdown but nothing much else went well for a team that ranks at or near the bottom of the league in numerous offensive categories a with 45 seconds left in the first half was the jets first td in three weeks wilson finished seven of 15 for 81 yards with an interception boyle was 7 of 14 for 33 yards and an interception buffalos offense by comparison showed signs of rhythm balance and imagination which were all issues that became apparent under dorsey most important the offenses ability to build and maintain an early lead took the pressure off an injury

seconds left and a chance to at least try a desperation heave or a quick play to set up a field goal try coach sean mcdermott instead elected to have allen take a knee after the bills went ahead with a field goal on the first possession of ot hurts scooted for the score that made the eagles the only 10 1 team in the nfl he hit for 17 and 11 yard receptions in ot and dandre swift had a 16 yard run

regulation and early in ot we found a way at the end and made it happen hurts said allen threw for 339 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 81 yards and two scores for the bills who are in danger of missing the playoffs after winning the afc east the past three years but he was intercepted in the fourth quarter by james bradbury setting up hurts 29 yard td pass to zaccheaus for a 28 24 philly

played a miserable first half throwing for 33 yards while the eagles had 99 yards overall it couldnt have been much worse of a first half sirianni said that was an offensive explosion in the second half it had to be the mvp candidate rallied his team just as he did a week earlier at kansas city hurts connected with from 3 yards and smith from 10 yards to get philly back into the game the difference is i think its the mindset eagles defensive end said its not like oh jalen threw a pick we dont feel that whatever it is dont complain about it go do something about it given a short field after allens pick the eagles faced third and 15 hurts rolled left and connected with zaccheaus who used two hands and hugged the ball against his chest as he fell toward the back of the end zone we

on an offensive player but replays showed that toneys foot was clearly  that didnt make the call  who chased after three different officials for an explanation or with chiefs coach andy reid who was still incensed after walking out of the locker room afterward its a bit embarrassing for the national football league for that to take place reid said it was the second straight week the chiefs 8 5 were dealing with questionable officiating last week in green bay they were left wondering why pass interference was not called on a pass intended for  loss for words man mahomes said to end another game and were talking about referees its bad for the nfl it was good for the bills 7 6 though and they sure needed something positive to happen their week began with questions swirling around pass

used the hijackers from sept 11 2001 in a team meeting to stress the importance of communication and was left apologizing again  just as he did after realizing how his mistake four years ago just so thankful im grateful for so many things mcdermott said so many people that reached out andy reid many of their staff after the game i know quite a few of the coaches on their staff theyre a class act

83 yards and a score the bills had been 2 6 in games decided by six points or fewer and they had lost a lead in the final two minutes in three losses it wasnt the prettiest of wins we all know that

the chiefs from losing for the fourth time in six games its a gut check chiefs guard said you got to dig down deep we still have games left to play the chiefs continued a recent track record of lousy starts on sunday mahomes was intercepted by aj epenesa on their first series they punted on each of their next three and it wasnt until the closing minutes of the first half that kansas city was able to sustain a drive that ended with s touchdown run by that point the bills had already reached the end zone twice the first touchdown came when cook was unchecked coming out of the backfield caught a

quarterback to reach 50 career rushing scores its tough because when youre playing a team with nothing to lose thats a dangerous team we gutted it out and we found a way said allen who completed 15 of 21 passes for 237 yards with an interception this is our playoffs it didnt matter how we get them done just get them done the bills 9 6 have won four of their last five buffalos playoff chances got some help earlier in the day when pittsburgh beat cincinnati indianapolis and houston are both 8 6 and hold the tiebreaker over the bills by virtue of a better conference record if either team loses buffalo would control one of the afcs final two spots heading into the last two weeks of the season buffalo fell behind 10 0 early in the second quarter but rallied from a double digit deficit to win for the fourth time since sean mcdermott became coach in 2017 the bills turned the ball over three times to keep the short handed chargers in the game in their first outing under interim coach giff smith  one day after the chargers were pummeled 63 21 at las vegas the chargers were doing some things that they hadnt shown this season they came in well prepared mcdermott said i thought our guys settled in and responded we did a good job in the red zone and had some big plays on third down to help us out kicked a career high five field goals and passed for 210 yards for los angeles 5 10 which has lost six of seven i think we went into this game thinking it was going to be a heavyweight fight and we wanted to have a chance at the end for a knockout smith said we were going to play it a little close to the vest get points on the board and give ourself a chance to win and thats the way it went came up a little bit short allen had four completions on the 13 play 64 yard game winning drive including a 15 yard reception by on third and 4 at the la 28 line with 229 remaining shakir got up after making the catch and ran to the end zone and officials signaled a touchdown but a replay review determined he was down by contact as an offense we want to score a touchdown and put them in an even more difficult situation obviously not scoring there allowed us to run down the clock down and they wasted their third and final timeout allen said allen leads the league with 40 total touchdowns 27 passing 13 rushing his 2 yard run off right tackle with 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter gave the bills a 14 10 lead allen had a 1 yard sneak late in the third quarter  his 51st career rushing td  to make it 21 13 allen benefited from a late push by running back   who had not caught a pass in the past two games after having six receptions for 105 yards against philadelphia had four receptions for a season high 130 yards including a early in the second quarter to get the bills within 10 7 allen scrambled right and found davis open downfield davis hauled in the pass at the chargers 19 and beat linebacker kenneth murray into the end zone it was allens second longest completion of the season sticking with it stick making his second nfl start in place of the injured  was 23 of 33 passing and rushed for a touchdown the fifth year quarterback directed the chargers to scores on two of their first three drives he early in the second quarter to give los angeles a 10 0 lead stick took advantage of a short field after recovered a fumbled punt by the bills  we were able to get the ball into the end zone and take the lead thats the way that you want to play it we just have to consistently execute better so that we feel better at the end stick said thats grand finished

will finish with their most losses since going 2 14 in 1992 it could be the fewest wins in coach bill belichicks tenure which he opened with a 5 11 record in 2000 obviously a terrible first 20 minutes from there we battled away but obviously gave them too big of a lead and couldnt quite get it back belichick said just stop turning it over once we did that we were competitive finished 16 of 26 for 209 yards and also  i dont think it was difficult to keep fighting because it was more about us than it was about them patriots center said the first half you cant do that you cant turn the ball over four times but no one lost belief not one lost faith obviously no one quit zappe had more interceptions three than the patriots had first downs two during new englands first six possessions the

group said allen who threw a go ahead touchdown pass to midway through the fourth quarter to rally buffalo past the 21 14 on sunday night so proud of our guys allen continued they battled their tails off the final couple of drives i felt we found a groove on the offensive side of the ball the ball was coming out of my hands the best all year allen made things difficult with three turnovers in miami territory but he finished with 359 yards and two touchdown passes for the bills who didnt clinch a playoff berth until tennessee beat jacksonville earlier sunday buffalo will host seventh seeded pittsburgh in the wild card round next sunday the bills were 5 5 in mid november and faced long odds just to make the playoffs they fired offensive coordinator ken dorsey after a week 10 collapse against denver from there they won six of seven  including five straight to close out the season miami which made the playoffs with its week 16 win over dallas fell to the sixth seed and will play at afc west champion kansas city on saturday night were going to have to come in tomorrow were going to have to watch the film see things we can get corrected and then move on quarterback said its a short week we know that and its going to be a tough road game for us the bills dominated time of possession and outgained miami by nearly 200 yards but offensive miscues in the first half stalled their momentum buffalo trailed 14 7 before returned a punt 96 yards for a touchdowna early in the fourth quarter i blacked out harty said afterward i cant tell you what happened id just seen a crease i hit it and the next thing you know i was free buffalo then forced a three and out and allen directed an eight play 74 yard drive capped by his 5 yard toss to knox with 716 left give all the glory to the lord said knox whose  played football at florida international university less than 30 miles from hard rock stadium im just thankful that my number was called but i think anyone in here when their number was called they stepped up tonight miami had one last chance but intercepted tagovailoa on a pass intended for with 113 left allen finished 30 of 38 and was intercepted on back to back drives

of the leagues most turnover prone quarterbacks with 14 interceptions and he had another one on buffalos second drive on a fourth down heave across his body dolphins safety came down with it but miamis offense fizzled as buffalo forced four punts and a turnover down the stretch the dolphins closed the season with two straight losses and now will face a chiefs team that beat them 21 14 in

have mattered we would have come out here and played when we were told to play the game turned into a celebration of the elements snow inside highmark stadium when the gates opened and was put to good use by fans who tossed handfuls into the air like confetti to celebrate we put on a show in the snow left tackle said were here we got one more week the second seeded bills 12 6 who closed the regular season with five straight wins advance to host and the no 3 seed in the divisional round on sunday night buffalo and its fans have longed for a home playoff game against the chiefs after their 2020 and 21 seasons ended with playoff losses at kansas city were a step behind already allen said noting the chiefs will have two more days of rest after beating miami on saturday its going to take a team effort we know the type of team that they are obviously the type of quarterback that they have in pat over there buffalo led 21 0 before pittsburgh scored on three straight possessions to get within 24 17 allen then sealed the win throwing a with 627 remaininga shakir caught the pass at the 10 over the middle slipped minkah fitzpatricks tackle attempt with a spin move and outraced the rest of the steelers defenders into the end zone dude hit me and i was able to just stay up and make a play from there shakir said but that comes down to allen getting the ball putting it right on the money and giving me an opportunity to make a play allen finished 21 of 30 for 203 yards and ran for 74 yards on eight carries becoming the first quarterback in nfl playoff history to throw three or more td passes while rushing for 70 or more yards and a score he didnt have a turnover for just the fourth time this season threw two touchdown passes with an interception in his first playoff start for the steelers 10 8 but pittsburgh was too inconsistent on either side of the ball to keep up with allen and the bills the steelers lost their fifth straight playoff game the franchises most recent postseason victory was exactly seven years ago missed tackles two turnovers that led to 14 points for buffalo and the bills ability to bottle up the steelers running attack contributed to the loss im appreciative of the efforts but its not mystical we didnt do what was required to win tonight steelers coach mike tomlin said cant come into an environment like this with a playoff caliber team and turn the ball over like that and expect to be competitive asked about his future in pittsburgh after completing his 17th season  all of them with a record of 500 or better   when we got it down to seven points i thought we were going to make a run it comes back to the defense veteran defensive tackle cam heyward said there were chances we didnt capitalize that was probably the biggest outlier in the game the elements didnt play much of a factor though temperatures were in the teens the skies were clear and there was only a slight breeze blowing in off lake erie the bills asserted themselves at the start allens 9 yard touchdown pass to capped an 80 yard opening drive after buffalo linebacker recovered receiver george pickens fumble at the pittsburgh 29 allen threw a td pass to on the next play allens touchdown run came after cornerback intercepted rudolphs pass intended for in the end zone the steelers finally capitalized on one of the bills few errors of the half when coach sean mcdermott elected to attempt a 49 yard field goal into the wind with a little more than two minutes left blocked tyler bass low kicka the ball squirted some 20 yards into bills territory and was recovered by at buffalos 33 the steelers scored five plays later on rudolphs 10 yard td pass to johnson the bills overcame a rash of injuries to their defense bernard was ruled out after twisting his right ankle and starting nickelback did not return after being evaluated for a concussion the bills began the game without cornerback knee and linebacker shoulder weve got a resilient group allen said of a team that was 6 6 after an overtime loss to philadelphia on nov 26 the veteran leadership that we have i really think its unmatched in the league ap nfl "}, "401547758": {"id":

neutral sites  and improving his postseason record to 13 3 first of all this is a great environment man mahomes said of buffalo it really is we did hear it all week man about playing a road game and were here to prove a point and show that we can play anywhere the chiefs are accustomed to ending the bills season having done it now in three of the past four playoffs with the first two wins coming

36 overtime loss in the divisional round a year later the game has since been dubbed 13 seconds because thats how much time was left for mahomes to march the chiefs 44 yards on two plays to set up harrison butkers 49 yard field goal mahomes then clinched the win with a 9 yard touchdown pass to  who else  kelce the tight end didnt stick around to address reporters after this win as he was perhaps busy rushing out to visit with girlfriend pop music superstar taylor swift and his brother jason who celebrated watching his two td outing from a suite travis kelce celebrated his first

beer mahomes was 17 of 23 for 215 yards and the two td passes to kelce were the 15th and 16th times theyve combined for scores in the playoffs they have one more than tom brady and for the nfl record for most playoff tds for a quarterback receiver combination it speaks to travis and his work to be able to go out there and make plays in big games mahomes said passing anything that has brady and

career playoff total to 563 the second most among nfl quarterbacks in league history and trailing only steve young 594 it was another disappointing finish for a bills team that won its fourth consecutive afc east title and was on a six game roll since a 20 17 win at kansas city on dec 10 just lost in the playoffs to a team thats kicked us out safety said its tough you work so hard

put up points despite resting quarterback again young didnt get much help from his offensive line as he was hit on three of his seven drop backs including a blindside shot to the center of his back from 293 pound defensive tackle on his first pass attempt it was a  young said i definitely could have done better and us as a unit all have to take accountability  we have to own this and get better youngs lack of size was the biggest concern when he entered the league but the 5 foot 10 204 pound quarterback bounced back to his feet after taking the hard hit from thomas i said to him well that was a  how did that one feel panthers coach frank reich said he said he was fine and barely felt it added panthers offensive tackle ickey ekwonu he shouldnt be getting hit at all at the end of the day that is on us as an offensive line we werent good enough today reich didnt seem overly concerned by carolinas lack of offensive production  the panthers had just 165 yards  saying the team was very generic on offense because he doesnt want to show the league too much of his playbook the jets 1 1 had no problem deciphering carolinas offense registering five sacks in the largest preseason shutout victory in team history i thought our d line got after them early and really for all four quarters made it hard for them to operate jets coach robert saleh said we represented who we are our style of play and that was a challenge from this week to last week rodgers debut with the jets will have to wait for another day as saleh held out the four time league mvp for the second straight preseason game the 39 year old rodgers hasnt played in a preseason game since 2018 with green bay got the start and played the entire first half leading the jets to scores on three of his six first half possessions he finished 14 of 20 for 123 yards including a 2 yard touchdown pass to backup tight end  wilson seemed to get more comfortable in the pocket as the game went on completing mostly short passes underneath the coverage i was trying to get the ball out of my hands quickly that was kind of my goal today wilson said the run after the catch when you get the ball in some of those guys hands they can really do something with it the jets outgained the panthers 189 32 in the first half and led 13 0 at the break i think he had three scoring drives so he was really efficient saleh said of wilson im really pumped for him hes taken great steps rookie ran for 37 yards on six carries including a 26 yard burst up the middle where the fifth round draft pick from pittsburgh dragged a defender for the final 5 yards before being taken down just short of the goal line after throwing an interception jets third stringer bounced back with td passes to tight ends ej jenkins and  boyle finished 9 of 10 for 84 yards carolina traded up from the ninth spot in the draft to get young with owner david tepper saying hes banking on the former alabama star to lead the franchise to multiple super bowl titles but if the panthers 0 1 are to snap a five year playoff drought and make some noise in the nfc south reich is going to need to dramatically improve the teams offensive line a dream come true despite his lack of production young called his first nfl preseason start surreal and a dream come true its something i will always remember but you are only able to live in that moment for a certain

his fifth season and is coming off a breakout year in which he helped new york reach the playoffs i thought we executed pretty well a couple plays could sharpen up a few things there well look to do that but overall i thought we executed well the only pass that jones threw that was incomplete was a drop by waller who promised to make it up to his quarterback down the road waller was very

most of his elevation from the saints practice squad while continues to make plays for unbeaten new orleans jones ran for two touchdowns rookie kicked two field goals and the saints beat the 20 17 on monday night improving to 2 0 for the first time since 2013 jones replaced the injured late in the first half and ran for 34 yards on 12 carries it was awesome saints coach dennis allen said he was great we ran the ball effectively i think we blocked it up front and he made the right cuts you know two touchdowns on the game it was big for him and big for us the saints defense did the rest holding panthers rookie to 153 yards passing in his home debut new orleans limited carolina 0 2 to 239 yards and sacked young the top overall pick in the draft four times they  young said they know exactly where they are supposed to be and the play well together obviously we didnt do enough offensively  their defense definitely got the best of us the saints nearly made it two full games without allowing a touchdown before giving up a 3 yard scoring toss from young to with 116 left in the game youngs 2 point conversion pass to thielen got the panthers within three but the saints recovered the onside kick and ran out the clock  who threw for 305 yards in the saints week 1 win over tennessee struggled early he had a badly underthrown interception into triple coverage and missed several other open receivers as the saints limped into the locker room at halftime with a 6 3 lead but carr improved in the second half he found olave who made the play of the game when hauled in a along the left sideline late in the third quarter for a 42 yard gain that set up jones 2 yard touchdown run to give the saints a 13 6 lead when things arent quite going exactly the way you want it to youre just one explosive play away from making something happen allen said i thought his concentration there and focus all the way through the catch point and to the ground maintaining possession was a progress for him olave had another short grab leading to jones second td with about three minutes to play he finished with six catches for 86 yards carr finished with 228 yards passing and the one pick change of pace quarterback was the saints leading rusher with 75 yards on nine carries theres so much that we have to clean up carr said but it feels good to get to do it when were 2 0 the saints pulled even with unbeaten atlanta and tampa bay atop the nfc south while the panthers fell into an early hole young spent a good portion of the night under pressure as the offensive line struggled carolina couldnt get much going in the running game was limited to 43 yards rushing the panthers offensive night was marred by miscues penalties and mental errors in the third quarter the panthers brought in youngs backup  presumably to run a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches but before dalton could take his first snap of the season guard jumped offside bailed out the offense with a 54 yard field goal one of his three on the night the panthers had a chance to tie the game just before halftime while facing third and 6 at the saints 18 but sacked young and forced a fumble that paulson adaebo recovered we wanted to be able to stop the run and make it where he was going to have to beat us throwing the ball allen said i felt like we might be able to get some pressure and make him uncomfortable a little bit panthers coach frank reich knew there would be some growing pains with a rookie quarterback but he thinks his offense is showing signs of breaking out despite totaling 27 points in two games its not that far away reich said i know it looks bad but its not that far away you make a few plays and youre at 28 points injuries saints williams left the game in midway through the second quarter and did not return panthers veteran lb was carted off the field late in the first quarter with a right ankle injury that reich said after the game was significant he said thompson

convincing second half effort after a shaky start and a frenzied crowd that caused problems for the opponent it felt like what it feels like to be here that was a thrill seattle coach pete carroll said rushed for 97 yards and two second half touchdowns kicked five field goals and the seahawks pulled away in the second half for a 37 27 win over the on sunday from 10 years ago and played with some similarity to that squad the seahawks leaned on their run game with walker and  their run defense stymied the panthers and eventually made them one dimensional and seattles crowd got in on the act leading to eight false start penalties for carolina that was amazing they were loud  we need more of that each and every home game defensive tackle said walker was a star on a day that didnt start smoothly for seattles offense he produced big plays both on the ground and in the pass game walkers 36 yard reception midway through the third quarter after seattle had settled for field goals every other time it reached carolinas side of the field walker later restored a two score lead for seattle 2 1 when he for a 7 yard touchdown with 1140 remaining charbonnet added 46 yards rushing and

a great game a lot of that is calls and then its up to the players to execute i just happened to be the guy that gets the publicity this week said woonum hes been making plays his entire career his

threw toward the left pylon and was intercepted by safety sam franklin who for a 7 0 lead very very frustrating to throw that interception cousins said poor read and then when youre late to the flat the balls left inside very disappointing play by me another cousins interception late in the first half  this time after he was hit in the pocket by as he was releasing the ball  led to s 56 yard field goal giving carolina a 13 7 lead at the half but the panthers didnt score in the second half and were limited 121 yards after the break cousins credited his defense for keeping the vikings in the game they made plays scored a touchdown and harrison smith was phenomenal cousins said that was big for our defense to get us the momentum back as carolina was driving and to turn it into seven points for us was huge vikings coach also praised his defense when we gave up an interception that resulted directly into points early those guys fought off that feeling of woe is me or here we go

criticism the suggestion that carolina made the wrong choice by taking him no 1 overall instead of  who has put up big numbers for houston it hasnt bothered the even keeled young he has been preoccupied with scenarios like the one he faced on sunday having a chance to lead his team to a victory in the fourth quarter the no 1 overall pick did just that moving the panthers 86 yards in 15 plays to set up s winning 23 yard field goal as time expired giving carolina its first victory of the season over the strouds texans 15 13 you love opportunities like that young said you go in and have a chance to end the game on your terms and just try to take the game down by one thats what we play for the winning drive included a clutch 3 yard completion in tight coverage to on a fourth and 2 to keep the chains moving it was a man look 1 on 1 and adam did a great job of creating separation and making a tough catch there young said that was a tough contested catch with the game on the line but its not surprising at all with adam the panthers 1 6 snapped a 56 game losing streak in games they trailed at any point in the fourth quarter the longest in nfl since at least 1991 carolinas last fourth quarter comeback win was oct 21 2018 against the  stroud selected second overall finished 16 of 24 for 140 yards and ran for a touchdown for houston 3 4 but houstons offense sputtered for most of the game it had just one play of longer than 20 yards against a panthers defense that had been annihilated over the previous two games allowing 84 points and 12 touchdowns i think with any quarterback especially a young quarterback defenses continue to game plan texans coach demeco ryans said you get more film on him and see what guys do well and you switch your game plan accordingly to put the quarterback in difficult spots hell just have to keep growing and keep learning cj will do well with it hell bounce back in the end young got the best of stroud just as he did when they first met as eighth graders in a football game in fontana california which that has continued until this day the two shared a pregame hug and young waited for stroud outside of the locker room after the game where they talked briefly young threw for 235 yards and a touchdown but it was his poise on the games final drive which should give some confidence to playoff starved panthers fans that he might be the right man for the job thielen said young was confident and ready for the moment entering the final drive it wasnt what he said  thielen said when you feel the energy and that confidence it gives you confidence that hey hes going to dish it hes going to find you just go do your job as for that that fourth down throw thielen said he put it only where i could catch it youngs teammates awarded him a game ball the ending was filled with drama with pineiro having to make the winning kick three times with the texans intentionally trying to jump offsides in an effort to rattle him pineiro made all three kicks   and they were trying their absolute best to get in my head pineiro said hopefully they have a safe flight back to houston young overcame six sacks and three drops by his wide receivers to record his first win since coming into the nfl out of alabama despite being under constant pressure he had his two longest completions of the season  40 and 31 yards thielen who is in the midst of a career season had eight catches for 72 yards caught a touchdown pass for the second straight game as the panthers won in their first game with offensive coordinator thomas brown calling the plays the win kept carolina from matching its worst start in franchise history the panthers were 0 7 to start the 1998 season the panthers trailed 7 6 at the halftime after pinero missed an extra point following youngs 1 yard touchdown pass to tremble but youngs 40 yard strike to fellow rookie set up one pineiro field goal and s strip of led to another field goal to give carolina a 12 7 lead stroud put the texans back on top 13 12 completing a 31 yard pass to to set up a 1 yard td run on a quarterback sneak the texans had a chance to push the lead to four midway through the fourth

to 29 yards on five receptions for the panthers 1 7 who matched their worst start in franchise history minshew threw for 127 yards and taylor ran for 47 yards for the colts 4 5 the colts dominated the panthers in the first half outgaining them 171 62 and took a 20 3 lead into the locker room after moore stepped in front of youngs pass in the flat to and took it 49 yards for a score carolina appeared to have regained momentum after cutting the colts lead to 10 in the third quarter before young overshot and moore grabbed it and to give the colts a 27 10 lead early in the fourth quarter it was a mistake filled first half for the panthers it started when recently signed lined up offside on a colts punt on fourth and 1 from deep in their end of the field that mental error gifted the colts with a first down and led to a 15 play drive that resulted in a 26 yard field goal by  the colts made it 10 0 after panthers safety was called for launching at colts wide receiver michael pittman on a crossing route setting up  you cant have penalties like that and be a good football team reich said after made it 13 3 young threw a pass in the flat toward hubbard that moore easily made a break on and took to the end zone the panthers showed some life in the third quarter behind miles sanders who has seen his playing time limited of late because of fumbles and ineffectiveness sanders made four big plays leading to  cutting the colts lead to 20 10 but moores second pick 6 all but sealed the win as reich failed to beat the colts who fired him last season injuries colts cb concussion wr knee

was like i gotta go i gotta get a spot in the end zone again bland said with a wide smile he called this his best touchdown return yet because it was his most athletic having to elude players en route

coaches and players but im frustrated for our fans as well  you want change to happen overnight but sometimes it takes longer than you want but you have to keep your head down and be strong willed and

unsportsmanlike conduct resulting in 30 penalty yards and two dallas first downs the first came when hit a sliding prescott several yards short of the first down marker on a third down run a few plays later pushed dallas in the back after an apparent third down stop prescott made the panthers pay with a 5 yard td pass in the corner of the end zone to lamb giving dallas a 17 3 lead heading into the locker room the panthers got back into the game in the third quarter after young converted three straight fourth downs two of those on completions to  the drive culminated in a 4 yard td pass from

getting the ball everybodys trying to stop him and he makes plays over and over bowles added its a credit to him his work ethic and the way he approaches the game evans finished with seven receptions

happy we got the win most importantly the 10th year pro said ive had a lot of great quarterbacks and offensive coordinators that believed in me so i really appreciate them hopefully i can keep that

pull within a field goal but no 1 overall draft pick threw an interception with just over two minutes remaining ending any chance of coming from behind to win the panthers debut under interim coach chris tabor i love those guys  i feel for them tabor said losing stinks and its hard and its frustrating but at the same time you can handle things two ways and thats what we talked about you can either handle it with character or you can handle it with compromise so which is it going to be i like our guys well just keep working scored an early touchdown and receiver scored on a 19 yard run

season firing of a coach matt rhule was dismissed in october 2022 two weeks before the panthers knocked off tom brady and the visiting bucs 21 3 evans had 10 catches for 207 yards that previous time the division rivals met in tampa he had a 40 yard reception to set up whites 1 yard td run in the first quarter then turned s throw into the long td that put the bucs ahead for good  one play after the first of hubbards two td runs put the panthers ahead 10 7 late in the third quarter we needed that said mayfield who completed 14 of 29 passes for 202 yards one touchdown and an interception we needed a little spark and he was the guy to bring it to us nobody is better than him young completed 15 of 31 passes for 178 yards and an interception s pick that ended the comeback bid the rookie was sacked four times of course no ones happy with how things have gone were all competitors but ultimately we play for each other young said each game is huge for us we are of that mindset young added so i cant lie and say its not frustrating but ultimately what permeates the locker room is the desire to want to be better desire to want to grow and play for each other ejection panthers lb was ejected

with 13 touchdown passes and only one interception any time we can get a win were going to celebrate that love said we kept our playoff hopes alive we found a way tonight obviously now its on to next week the packers 7 8 remain one game behind the and in the nfc wild card race we all know whats in front of us and we know what were capable of love said were just going to go finish this thing off

33 that fox sports rules analyst dean blandino said on television should have been overturned if i make the play the game is over doubs said and i made the play so the game was over love who finished 17 of 28 for 219 yards followed with a 20 yard completion to rookie tight end to reach the carolina 13 setting up carlsons winning kick we ran a stop route with doubs and he made a fantastic catch right there on the sideline which was a huge play in that drive love said and then coming back later the one to tucker i was able to fit it in between two guys and he was able to bounce off them and pick up some more yards so it was a huge catch by him and a great way to finish that drive two huge plays by those guys two great throws too carolina had one last chance young completed a 22 yard pass to chark on the sideline to stop the clock and then threw over the middle to for another 22 yards to the green bay 31 but the panthers without any timeouts were unable to spike the ball before time expired panthers interim coach chris tabor said he absolutely felt the team got the ball spiked before the clock ran out but he wasnt given an explanation after the game by the officials im disappointed for those guys in that room tabor said they laid everything on the line there and we played hard we just ran out of time but we are getting better and there is no doubt about that said packers coach matt lafleur it feels good to win certainly made it a little closer than we wouldve liked but give carolina a ton of credit they fought for for four quarters the bottom line is that we

host the next weekend in the wild card round of the playoffs the buccaneers werent exactly impressive on offense with held to 137 yards in his return to carolina but the defense  aided by some self inflected wounds by the panthers  did just enough they held the panthers to 199 yards and 11 first downs forced two turnovers and sacked rookie quarterback three times i cant say enough about our defense said mayfield who injured his ankle on sunday but remained in the game a lot of guys stepped up and made big plays on defense offensively we ran the ball when we needed to it wasnt a pretty win by any means and there is room for improvement but now that were in the playoffs were division champs lets hit the reset button and go from there tampa bay coach todd bowles said he likes the culture the bucs have built  and it carried over to the post tom brady era theres a lot of ways to skin a cat bowles said the guys believed in each other they never fed into the outside media we wrote our own narrative we worked hard we practiced hard and they got it done young finished 11 of 18 for 94 yards and the panthers had two potential touchdowns overturned carolina which lost 26 0 to the last week became the first team to be shutout in back to back games since the in 2008 it marked the first time in the panthers 29 year history theyve been blanked in consecutive games the panthers became the first nfl team since at least 1991 to fail to run a single play while leading in the fourth quarter of a game both of carolinas wins this season came on field goals at the end of regulation when it was trailing the panthers 2 15 finished with the nfls worst record and the franchises second worst winning percentage topping only a 1 15 season in 2001 under george seifert however carolina wont get the benefit of the no 1 overall draft pick in 2024 as that will go to the as part of the trade for young this locker room will change panthers interim coach chris tabor said of the upcoming offseason mayfield spent last season with the panthers but went 1 5 as a starter and was released midseason he played through some sore ribs and completed 20 of 32 passes ran for 75 yards for tampa bay the bucs took a 6 0 lead at halftime behind field goals of 36 and 57 yards from mclaughlin mclaughlin added a 39 yarder in the fourth quarter the panthers repeatedly made key mistakes just as bad teams do in the second quarter dj chark caught a pass from young and raced 43 yards down the sideline for an apparent touchdown but replays confirmed chark fumbled as he attempted to jump across the goal line bucs safety  punched the ball out and tampa bay recovered in the end zone for a touchback when i saw the receiver catch the ball i saw him stick the ball out with one hand so im like hes going to reach for it winfield said so i kept my leverage and once he reached i just punched it out and at the end of the third quarter panthers fill in kicker missed a 52 yard field goal after young took a sack on third down resulting in a costly 9 yard loss and running back had a 28 yard touchdown run called back in the fourth quarter when the panthers were flagged for an illegal formation we shot ourselves in the foot tabor said rough rookie season young suffered through a miserable rookie season in which he went 2 14 as a starter and threw for just 1793 yards per game with 11 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions three of which were returned for tds but tabor still sees a bright future for young i think when he is in year 12 and winning a lot of games and slicing people up a little bit i think he will remember this first year and probably look back and say you know what it stunk at the time but this helped me get to where i am at tabor said he has a really bright future injuries

as an afterthought that he thought taylor swift would take him up on his invitation to watch the play the on sunday some things with travis mahomes explained later he says it and you don t know if its true or not he says it so calmly turns out it was true mahomes and kelce put on quite their own show for the pop star too the reigning league mvp threw for 272 yards and three touchdowns his all pro tight end caught seven passes and one of the scoring throws and the chiefs romped to a 41 10 victory over the bears  much to the delight of their newest fan who joyfully pounded on the glass of her arrowhead stadium suite throughout the afternoon i havent gotten to meet her said mahomes who was left answering questions about kelce and swifts budding relationship after his good buddy ducked out on reporters i guess if she ends up being with travis ill meet her at some point had a pair of touchdown catches and and added touchdown runs helping the super bowl champion chiefs 2 1 deal the bears 0 3 their 13th consecutive loss dating to last season the game was so lopsided by the third quarter that mahomes and most of the chiefs starters got the rest of the day off we got things rolling and thats a plus against a defense that you know is banged up a little bit chiefs coach andy reid said a was 11 of 22 for 99 yards with an interception and a meaningless touchdown in the final minutes he also led the bears with 47 yards rushing a good chunk of that coming on a 17 yard scramble as the leagues 27th ranked offense finished with just 203 yards against one of the nfls fast improving defenses weve got to keep this thing tight in our locker room thats the most important thing bears coach matt eberflus said theres going to be a lot of outside noise as there always is in the nfl and weve played three games so far in the season weve got a great opportunity ahead of us weve got two games in 11 days and so were going to focus on that still their poor performance sunday was a brutal end to a dismal week of distractions in the span of a few hours wednesday bears defensive coordinator  citing the need to take care of my health and family and fields had to walk back some comments he made blaming his robotic play through the first two weeks on the way he had been coached eberflus was left to call defensive plays just as he did in last weekends loss to tampa bay and reid proceeded to make the former coordinator look utterly lost the chiefs began their assault with the first of mahomes two td passes to mckinnon then edwards helaire scored from a yard out to make it 14 0 early in the second quarter when the bears punted a third consecutive time mahomes hit mckinnon again to extend the lead and kansas city proceeded to score on its next four possessions as for fields well the qb was not just robotic but inaccurate when one of the leagues most porous offensive lines wasnt allowing the chiefs to pressure him fields was consistently missing open targets down field i need to be better fields said simply he was picked off by late in the first half leading to pachecos touchdown run and when added the second of his two field goals the chiefs were able to take a 34 0 lead into the break kelce added his short touchdown catch early in the second half celebrating in the back of the end zone by revving the engine on an imaginary motorcycle high above the stadium swift clapped her hands alongside his mother donna kelce on friday he was like yeah i think shes coming to the game this weekend and went about his business mahomes recalled after the game and youre like i guess that just happens thats travis stats and streaks the bears have not won in kansas city since week 5 of the 2015 season  reid won his 271st game moving him past hall of fame coach tom landry into fourth place on the career list  mahomes went over 25000 yards passing for his career he did it in 83 games the fastest in nfl history  mahomes had his 22nd game with three td passes and no interceptions tying for the most by a qb before turning 30 mahomes turned 28 last sunday  kelce needs three more td catches to pass tony gonzalez 76 for second in chiefs history injuries bears starting safety was inactive with a foot injury and cornerback was dealing with a hamstring injury all before cornerback had to be evaluated for a concussion he later was deemed to have an illness and

minutes remaining and the broncos bounced back from one of the most lopsided losses in franchise history by rallying to beat the 31 28 on sunday denver 1 3 was coming off that was the franchises second worst loss of the super bowl era behind only a 51 0 pounding by the raiders in 1967 lutzs 51 yarder capped a comeback from a 28 7 third quarter deficit then intercepted with the bears 0 4 near midfield and coach sean payton picked up his first win with denver everybody just believed wilson said it was a beautiful demonstration of resilience chicago looked like it was headed toward an easy win leading by 21 after fields threw a 2 yard touchdown to late in the third quarter instead the bears dropped their 14th in a row since a week 7 win at new england last season the bears had a chance to break a 28 all tie late in the fourth quarter chicago opted to go for it on fourth and 1 at the 18 rather than kick a field goal coach matt eberflus was confident the bears would get the first down because of how effectively they were running the ball but instead of keeping the drive going herbert got stopped fields said he loved the decision to go for it after all he said it showed coach has trust in us to convert in that situation fields threw for a career high 335 yards and four touchdowns he completed his first 16 passes and was 28 of 35 i think we were in a rhythm offensive coordinator luke getsy was dialing it up fields said guys were protecting up front receivers were getting open we were definitely in a rhythm at the end of the day we lost the game so it really doesnt matter wilson threw a 4 yard td to near the end of the third and a 13 yarder to early in the fourth to make it a seven point game the bears then had the ball near midfield when strip sacked fields jonathan cooper recovered the fumble at the 35 and returned it for the tying touchdown  with a 48 yard pass to the 33a on the next play the broncos took the lead when lutz kicked his field goal with 151 remaining and a fans showered the bears with boos as the game ended wilson threw for 223 yards the nine time pro bowler completed 21 of 28 passes i dont think he blinked once cooper said everybody kept their composure everybody stuck together kept fighting and thats what a team does ran for 72 yards and caught a touchdown pass for denver therell be some tough tape tomorrow payton said i dont want to sugarcoat anything were gonna play a lot better teams on our schedule and no disrespect to chicago and matt eberflus and what theyre trying to do im sure the feelings the same here but i think the win was important for the group caught eight passes for 131 yards and a touchdown for chicago cole kmet added 85 yards receiving and two tds herbert ran for 103 yards and caught a td pass but after getting blown out by and the defending super bowl champion  the bears came up short again still stinging cooper said the loss to miami still stings he called it a chip that were gonna carry for

an interception scooped up the loose ball near the left sideline and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown making it 19 6 it just felt like he was not going to be denied a chance to be the guy or to go out there and respond coach said how he was on the sideline how he was all week in prep  im really really happy with jordan proud of him as one of our core leaders showing up the way he did today bagent  undrafted out of division ii shepherd university  cut it to 19 13 midway through the fourth when he scored from the 1 for his first touchdown capping a 77 yard drive the bears were at the

had 51 yards receiving coming off a career best 230 yard outing and the bears dropped their 10th straight home game it was a step back for a team with a chance to put together back to back wins for the first time since weeks 16 and 17 of the 2021 season when the bears beat seattle and the  we could look at it that way moore said weve got things to improve we had a great game last thursday but it

didnt need much time to get comfortable the butterflies went away after about the first snap once he got that out of the way the rookie looked like a quarterback who had been here and done this before bagent led three touchdown drives in his first start with sidelined donta foreman ran for two scores and caught a td pass and the beat the 30 12 on sunday where i come from ive got a bunch of friends a bunch of family that understood how big this was just in a life said bagent who grew up in martinsburg west virginia and went undrafted out of division ii shepherd university in his home state not a lot of people get to say they started in an nfl game let alone win an nfl game definitely had a lot of those conversations today i think the staff understood it too and the players thats why everybody rallied behind me as well as they did the bears 2 5 won for the second time in three games after dropping 14 in a row they came out on top in a showdown of backup quarterbacks after both teams starters were injured the previous week fields dislocated his right thumb in a loss to minnesota while las vegas exited a win over new england with a back problem threw for 129 yards and two interceptions and the raiders 3 4 got blown out after winning back to back games we didnt do anything well enough to deserve to win coach josh mcdaniels said the bears simplified the game plan and relied on short throws and handoffs with an undrafted rookie behind center bagent  who debuted last week after fields got knocked out of that game early in the second half  had family and friends at the game he put on a steady performance for them completing 21 of 29 passes for 162 yards and a td helping chicago stop a 10 game home losing streak i think he was just himself nothing different and nothing any different than we have seen through preseason up until now foreman said i think we all expected him to be that type of guy to come out there and do what he did today so no surprise foreman ran for 89 yards on 16 attempts and his first two touchdowns since signing with chicago in march he in the first quarter and as the bears grabbed a 14 0 lead then in the third to make it 21 3 caught eight passes for 54 yards kicked a 54 yard field goal in the fourth quarter had an interceptiona that led to a touchdown run for foreman and picked off two passes late in the game he returned one against hoyer to make it 30 6 and then intercepted chicago area product aidan oconnell the offensive line held up for the most part against star edge rusher  who had one sack the defense took the ball away three times while limiting las vegas to 235 yards and the bears secured their first victory at soldier field since week 3 last season against houston hoyer completed 17 of 32 passes and posted a 371 passer rating after mcdaniels opted to go with a 15 year veteran rather than a rookie oconnell was 10 of 13 for 75 yards with a touchdown and interception  usually a thorn in the bears side caught seven passes for 57 yards the three time all pro came in with 81 catches for 1024 yards and 10 touchdowns in 16 games against chicago ran for just 35 yards on 11 attempts not to discredit anything they did because i feel like they played a pretty solid game all around but it definitely had nothing to do with any crazy things that they did adams said its more of us hurting ourselves fields update coach matt eberflus said fields remains the no 1 quarterback but its not clear when hell be back eberflus said fields is scheduled to see the doctors on monday injuries raiders lb ankle was hurt defending a quarterback sneak early in the second quarter bears s got shaken up on a pick play defending a 2 point conversion pass attempt near the end of the game eberflus said he didnt know

have a game where they could put all three phases together was hoping for a performance where he didnt spend five minutes discussing the broken middle finger on his non throwing hand both can say they reached their goals as the chargers routed the 30 13 in front of a prime time audience i think so staley said when asked if this was his teams most complete performance of the season i thought thats we were in search of was to feel that complete game where youre feeding off each other and the levels are high the whole way herbert  who passed for 298 yards and three touchdowns  directed the chargers 3 4 to points on their first five drives marking the first time in six seasons they have accomplished that feat herbert the past two games after breaking the middle finger of his left hand four weeks ago completed his first 15 passes and was 31 of 40 i think just every week its getting better said herbert who didnt wear a glove on his left hand and just went with the finger heavily bandaged for the first time i thought we had a great plan we went out there and executed exactly what we were going to do im not surprised that we had great success moving the ball early it was the first time in two years that herbert passed for three tds in the first half finding  and donald parham to help stake the chargers to a 24 7 lead at the break the chargers looked like they were going to be in for another long night on defense when chicagos connected with for a 41 yard completion down the right sideline on the first play that would be the only play though the chargers allowed of at least 20 yards derwin james and gave los angeles their first game with two interceptions this season the defense also came up with three fourth down stops i think we did a good job of stopping the run first and the defensive backs did a really good job of taking the ball away i think it was just a solid game all around said linebacker  who had a sack on special teams had his second game this season with three field goals with two coming in the second half bagent had a more difficult time in his second nfl start the undrafted rookie was 25 of 37 for 232 yards with two interceptions he did have a 1 yard sneak late in the fourth quarter to get the bears within 30 13 bagents 2 point pass attempt was incomplete i feel like there were a lot of plays where im getting through my reads and making correct throws and then i think there are a couple where  i did maybe force the issue a bit so got to do a better job of that going forward bagent said the bears still havent won consecutive games since the last two weeks of the 2021 season the glaring things that stood out to me and what my message was at halftime for the players was we had a lot of penalties on offense that set us back and then on defense it was really simply about fundamentals that was where they got their opportunities coach matt eberflus said ekelers milestones austin ekeler finished with 123 scrimmage yards including seven receptions for 94 yards los angeles scored on its opening drive for the fourth time this season when ekeler took herberts screen pass  that made ekeler the first running back in the super bowl era to reach 30 td catches with the same team and the seventh player in nfl history to have 30 touchdowns rushing and 30 receiving you dont really know how the chips are gonna fall when the game starts going you go with the flow and tonight the ball was coming my way ekeler said bouncing back with 147 remaining in the first half took bagents toss and went 11 yards to get the bears 2 6 within 17 7 however the chargers regained momentum before halftime with a nine play 75 yard drive culminating in  where he broke a couple tackles before getting over the goal line i thought we really fed off each other today we gave up the touchdown drive we kind of finished the two minute before the half with a big time score staley said it was just kind of a surgical drive justin was just accurate the whole way down there so 24 7 was a lot better than 17 7 injuries bears lb tremaine edwards went down with a knee injury during the third quarter and did not return chargers te was

intercepted two passes and also forced a fumble that he recovered and the saints beat the bears 24 17 on sunday the receiving td made him the first nfl player since hall of famer frank gifford who retired after the 1964 season to score 10 or more times each as a passer 11 runner 26 and receiver 10 thats pretty impressive right saints coach dennis allen said half the guys in our locker room would have no idea who frank gifford is hill a 33 year old former byu quarterback said he did know of gifford primarily because hed been told about him by saints stats keepers i look at back at my career and i certainly didnt think it would have gone the way it has hill said but as i hear and think about stuff like that its overwhelming i have a lot of gratitude to be able to be part of this program and play with coaches who are creative enough to give me opportunities the saints 5 4 forced five turnovers intercepting a three times and recovering two fumbles those plays tipped the balance of a game in which the undrafted bagent and the bears 2 7 often had the saints defense off balance outgaining new orleans 368 301 in total yards and possessing the ball for just more than half the game the final turnover  a fumble caused by  sack and recovered by fellow linebacker  all but sealed it with 205 left new orleans needed only one first down  and got it  to run out the clock bagent passed for two touchdowns to tight end  he finished with 220 yards passing and 70 yards rushing to keep chicago within one score the whole way despite the bears being minus 5 in turnovers there wasnt a lot good that i saw defensively allen said but the takeaways were outstanding and thats the difference in the game the saints had a chance to take a 10 point lead on rookie kicker s 47 yard field goal attempt with 230 left but the ball hit the left upright that gave the bears a chance to drive for a late tying touchdown  until davis pivotal sack and strip it really just comes all down to myself in that last quarter being able to do a better job taking care of the ball bagent said we talk about it every day and it was basically just me good on their part and bad on my part passed for 211 yards and two touchdowns for the saints the a and the  hill hit tight end in the back of the end zone in the fourth quarter the saints didnt take their first lead until s fumblea  caused and recovered by adebo  moments after what would have been a first down catch to the chicago 40 in the third quarter that set up grupes 55 yard field goal to put new orleans up 17 14 chicago drove 13 plays to the saints 13 yard line before settling for  field goal to tie it at 17 seeking their first victory in the superdome since 1991 the bears started fast bagent found kmet for to cap a nine play 75 yard opening drive but adebos first interception near midfield set up a tying td on carrs 8 yard pass to olave bagents  from 9 yards out briefly put the bears back in front before carr drove new orleans right back down the field for a 2 yard scoring pass to hill for the utility players fourth td in his past three games santos who kicked for tulane when the green wave played home games in the superdome hit the upright from 40 yards out in the final minute of the half his first miss this season kept the score tied at halftime level assessment adebo a third year pro who now leads the club with four interceptions sounded disinclined to bask in a performance that he said was probably my best theres plays that i made mistakes on and whatnot that maybe havent been highlighted he said its

crazy zany wild and weird who could have wrote this story clevelands star defensive end asked not even dr seuss it doesnt get more abstract than what weve gone through passed for 374 yards  212 in the fourth quarter  and set up  34 yard field goal with 32 seconds left before the browns to beat the 20 17 on sunday making his third start since signing with cleveland last month the 38 year old flacco overcame three interceptions and made several brilliant throws in the closing minutes to rally the browns 9 5 from a 10 point fourth quarter deficit cleveland has won six games by four points or fewer flacco who went 11 of 13 in the final quarter  into tight coverage  to wide receiver with 308 left that tied it at 17 all the browns got the ball back with 150 remaining and flacco the fourth qb to start for cleveland this season completed two passes for 65 yardsa to set up hopkins go ahead kick the bears 5 8 who blew 17 7 lead nearly pulled off a stunning finish with no time left chicago quarterback lofted a pass from the 45 yard line to the end zone into a pack of players two browns defenders batted the ball down but it went directly to bears receiver  who was lying on his back the ball bounced in and out of mooneys hands and he kicked it into the air allowing browns safety to intercept it and avoid a catastrophic ending for cleveland its tough and crazy mooney said how many times do you see that hail mary work and actually be able to maybe catch it the play was a blur to browns coach kevin stefanski i blacked out he said garrett had a firsthand view after chasing fields from the pocket he kind of looked at me just made sure i was far enough away and then tossed it up garrett said i was like please lord dont let us be one of these like youtube compilations for a moment fields thought the bears had pulled it out i heard some celebration on the sideline he said and then it was kind of like awww then i saw the guy picked off the pass the browns stayed in the no 5 playoff spot in the afc its a remarkable achievement considering theyre without starting quarterback and star running back  and they lost five regulars to season ending injuries just this week weve been through four quarterbacks garrett said its not going to shake us because weve literally been through it all with injuries and everything else so this is just another step in our journey another opportunity for us to write a very peculiar but great legacy flacco has quickly become a hero in cleveland his longtime rival when he played for baltimore the 15 year veteran has thrown for 939 yards in three games flacco showed resilience after his picks one of which a for a 45 yard touchdown on clevelands first play of the second half to put the bears ahead 14 7 believe me part of you wants to crawl into a hole somewhere and hide from everybody but you cant do that flacco said especially somebody like me ive been in this league a long time and youve seen so much happen you just have to keep your eyes on whats next you have to continue to look forward and continue to have faith that your teammates are going to get themselves in the right positions for you to get the ball to them no

card berth with a 17 9 victory over the on sunday the packers bounced back from a 2 5 start by winning seven of their last 10 games including three straight i think everyone knew what we were capable of love said all the games we lost were close games that we knew there were little things we could fix that would put us over the hump to win those games i think we were always right there in every game so that was the thing that was easy for us to keep believing the packers 9 8 needed a win to reach the playoffs green bay delivered by beating the bears 7 10 for a 10th consecutive time green bay was in a similar situation for its regular season finale last year but at home to the in  last game with the packers the packers to the less than four months later to make way for love a 2020 first round draft pick from utah state love guided the nfls youngest team to the postseason by throwing 18 touchdown passes and one interception over his last eight games i said it back in camp hes the best quarterback in the league packers cornerback said and hes been proving it these past few weeks green bay is the nfcs no 7 seed and will visit nfc east champion dallas 12 5 next sunday in a matchup with cowboys coach mike mccarthy who guided the packers from 2006 18 and led them to their last super bowl title love went 27 of 32 as green bay never punted all day love threw a 10 yard touchdown pass to wicks that put green bay ahead for good midway through the second quarter and found the rookie fifth round pick in the end zone again for a 12 yard score in the third hes a tough minded sucker packers coach matt lafleur said of love his family did a hell of a job raising him just in terms of what hes all about love spent most of this season throwing primarily to rookies and second year pros those guys helped win the game sunday though they didnt win any praise from bears safety  caught four passes for 112 yards wicks had six catches for 61 yards to go with his two touchdowns had five receptions for 62 yards less than a week after the packers signed him to their active roster from the practice squad i feel like we could have tightened up on the receivers a lot more than we did today said brisker who recovered a fumble by love we gave them too much room i dont really have no respect for them at all just to be honest green bays rushed for 111 yards on 22 carries his third straight 100 yard performance chicago now heads into the offseason facing a about its quarterback situation the bears have the no 1 pick in the upcoming draft and must decide whether to keep or select his potential replacement i control what i can control fields said and im going to get healthy this offseason spend time with my family and get better like i said we went through the same thing last year we had the no 1 pick everybody was asking what if what if what if and nothing happened im not saying that nothing might happen because shoot we all dont know the bears had the first overall pick last year but to carolina which used it to select alabama quarterback  part of the package the bears got in exchange was carolinas no 1 selection this year which will be the top overall selection since the panthers 2 15 had the nfls worst record fields went 11 of 16 for 148 yards on sunday but he couldnt get the bears into the end zone he was sacked five times and had eight carries for 27 yards the bears reached packers territory on each of their six series but had only nine points to show for it capped the games first series with a 50 yard field goal that bounced off the left upright before going through santos also had a 39 yarder late in the second quarter and a 35 yarder early in the fourth the bears got inside green bays 35 midway through the fourth quarter but a holding penalty and a sack caused the drive to stall and forced a punt green bay took over at its own 6 with 608 left and held the ball the rest of the game we knew going into that last drive that we wanted to finish with the ball and keep the defense off the field and not even give them a chance to get the ball back love said i think thats just that killer mindset that everyone in the locker room on

his job to name himself s backup  or potentially the week 1 starter if the  coach zac taylor wont do so yet either but its pretty clear browning strengthened his case for the job with his play in

i feel pretty good about what i put on tape and all that and practices have been going well browning said well see how this thing shakes out journeyman  who has been competing with browning for the no

his right calf in practice in late july taylor has refused to answer questions about burrows progress other than to say the 26 year old looks as good as he ever has brownings next regular season nfl snap will be his first but the bengals 0 2 1 dont seem worried about that given his extensive exhibition and practice experience sometimes guys just need game reps taylor said i think jakes one of those guys that he needed the nfl game experience thats what hes gotten here the last couple years theres no qb drama for the commanders who already as their startera with veteran set to back up brissett played the first three series completing 10 of 15 passes for 96 yards with a 39 yard touchdown completion to  an undrafted free agent receiver who had three catches for 89 yards and may have earned a spot on washingtons 53 man roster i thought tinsley really showed really well and obviously he made a couple plays for us coach ron rivera said played the majority of the game and threw for 144 yards and two tds to wrap up a 3 0 preseason for the commanders its the first time washington finished exhibition play undefeated since 2013 winning begets winning rivera said it creates a good atmosphere it creates a positive vibe and were going to grow from it does it mean were going to win in the regular season dont know but i hope it does i hope its something that we can draw from something we can relate to something that can help us as we go forward nearly every starter for either team sat out to avoid the risk of injuries the commanders already lost a top player to a preseason injury when sprained a toea on his right foot late in the first half  and now the no 1 receivers status for week 1 is uncertain the only expected starters who got onto the field for

browns harassed burrow from the start and won an opener at home for the first time since 2004 they wanted to prove a point watson said of clevelands defense so i know they handled what they needed to handle those guys are fired up they bring the swagger they bring the energy and i think weve seen that today chase who finished with five catches for 39 yards didnt take back his inflammatory comments in fact he doubled down im mad because i called their butts elves and we just lost to some elves chase said im pissed on my part expletive im holding it on me watson late in the first half making the kind of dynamic play the browns envisioned when they signed him to a 230 million contract in 2022 he missed 11 games last season for violating the leagues personal conduct policy watson is in uniform from the start this season and his presence has cleveland expecting big things he added a 3 yard td pass in the fourth quarter to tight end  and watson celebrated by skipping down the field in front

help seal clevelands stunningly easy win over the afc north champions the browns forced the bengals to punt 10 times in 14 possessions the bengals pulled burrow with 515 left and he spent the

zone getting a seal block from wide receiver  stefanski and offensive coordinator alex van pelt celebrated with a big hug after the qb crossed the goal line stefanski credited van pelt for adding the play on saturday and watson said he checked out of a pass before the run awesome play watson said awesome call burrow wasnt as mobile as usual due to the calf issues and the misty wet weather didnt help him either as he struggled to get a good grip in the first half before putting on a glove bengals coach zac taylor who dropped to 0 5 against cleveland said the conditions altered the game plan immediately it was a different game than weve had to play in a long long time with the rain he said they did a great job managing the conditions remembering brown the browns honored the late hall of

takes a lot to be a quarterback and also be injured we needed to get this win chase said i was just being there for joe all i could do is try to make joe look good s 14 yard touchdown runa in the third quarter gave the reigning afc north champs their first lead of the season meanwhile linebacker picked off los angeles quarterback twice and the bengals sacked him six times stafford threw a 1 yard scoring pass to with just over a minute left in the game and the pat got the rams within three points but fell on the ensuing onside kick to seal the win for the bengals it wasnt clear until just before the game whether burrow would play the injury occurred early in training camp and he aggravated it late in the bengals loss to baltimore last week burrow returned to practice on thursday on a limited basis and on saturday the team listed him as questionable in the workout today i felt good enough to play burrow said dont have any setbacks was basically the criteria its still day to day its good to get through this one its going to be better this week than it was last week the cincinnati defense was outstanding stafford was sacked twice by a and wilson intercepted him once in each half the second two interception game of the fourth year linebackers career our defense kept us right in this thing bengals coach zac taylor said stafford finished 18 for 39 for 269 yards as the rams slipped to 1 2  whose 25 receptions for 266 yards in his first two games was a rookie record  led the rams with five catches for 72 yards mixon was a workhorse again carrying 19 times for 65 yards on cincinnatis first possession of the second half he went over left tackle and found a seam to score from 14 yards out his first td of the season to cap a 10 play 75 yard drive it did feel like we were in striking distance rams coach sean mcvay said i thought the defense kept us in the game the whole night and i thought it was really unfortunate especially early on where we had to settle for field goals where we had some of the looks and some of the opportunities to be able to execute and we just werent able to get it done ring of honor former quarterback boomer esiason and receiver chad

since  well since  stroud a former ohio state quarterback and the second overall pick in this years draft by the  bested burrow and ended a four game win streak by the on sunday the 22 year old threw for 356 yards and led a drive over the final 93 seconds that put in range for a game winning 38 yard field goal as time ran out and houston beat cincinnati 30 27 ammendola had just been signed on tuesday because kaimi fairbairn suffered a quadriceps injury a week earlier stroud directed a winning drive in the last minute for the second straight week for the texans 5 4 who pulled out when the rookie put together a 75 yard touchdown drive in the final 40 seconds the thing about cj is just the calmness in the chaos texans coach demeco ryans said he doesnt waver hes confident hes going to make plays thats the kind of thing usually said about burrow the fourth year quarterback known for his decision making and late game heroics burrow also had a good day statistically  347 yards passing and two touchdowns  but he threw back to back interceptions in the fourth quarter one in the end zone to kill the bengals chances intercepted stroud with 341 remaining in the fourth quarter and two plays later rushed for a 1 yard touchdown to cut houstons lead to 27 24 but another opportunity for cincinnati fell short when couldnt hold on to burrows pass in the end zone on third and goal with 139 left and the bengals 5 4 had to settle for a field goal by to tie the game instead of taking the lead that was a tough loss burrow said i thought we were going to pull it out we didnt make a play at the end of the day its disappointing stroud moved the texans 55 yards in six plays to set up the game winning field goal by ammendola the rookie connected with for 25 yards and for 22 yards on the decisive drive the bengals knew it would come down to the wire we knew that too stroud said i just went to demeco and let him know man i got you were going to win this game he looked me right in the eye and said ill trust you stroud was 23 for 39 passing including a and an interception brown finished with seven catches for a season high 172 yards and rushed for 150 yards  i took a lot of big hits this game but my o line they fought their tails off stroud said i think thats where we won the game our o line had three sacks for the texans who held cincinnati to 66 rushing yards coming back cincinnati rallied after going down 20 7 on singletarys 6 yard run in the third quarter a 50 yard field goal by mcpherson and cut the deficit 20 17 by the end of the third but burrow wasted that momentum by throwing picks on the bengals first two fourth quarter possessions from the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the third the bengals punted five straight times i felt like we just flipped in the second quarter said  who caught one of burrows touchdown passes i dont know what happened more cj stroud became the fourth rookie in nfl history to compile at least 2500 passing yards in his first nine starts his 470 yards and five touchdowns in the win over tampa bay were rookie single game records injuries cincinnati de went down with an unspecified injury in the fourth

days has gone from s little known backup to the potential savior of the bengals season making his third nfl start the 27 year old browning was outstanding again on sunday throwing two touchdown passes and rushing for a score as cincinnati beat the 34 14 with burrow out for the season with a wrist injury the bengals seemed in danger of slipping into irrelevance before browning threw for 354 yards and a touchdown in a win at jacksonville last monday night brownings follow up performance was just as good and it kept the bengals 7 6 in the mix for a playoff spot he completed 18 of 24 passes for 275 yards with an interception against the playoff contending colts 7 6 whose four game winning streak ended hes playing his butt off said cincinnati receiver  who caught two passes for 72 yards hes playing like a true no 1 quarterback and thats all you can ask for threw for 240 yards with a touchdown and an interception for the colts whose offense stalled after halftime the game was tied at 14 all at the break but indys first four second half possessions ended with two punts a pick thrown by minshew and a failed fourth down attempt a lot of self inflected wounds minshew said meanwhile the bengals scored on their first two drives of the second half  a and a 1 yard keeper by browning it was just one of those days indianapolis coach shane steichen said it was not our day i have full confidence in that group in that locker room that well get it cleaned up rookie running back had that opened the scoring brown grabbed a short pass out of the backfield and raced untouched down the right sideline juking safety rodney thompson ii at the 6 yard line on the way to the end zone after colts kicker bounced a 38 yard field goal attempt off the left upright the bengals scored again benefiting from two indianapolis penalties cincinnati put together a 72 yard drive finished with a 1 yard td plungea the colts kept the ball for the next 822 and minshew threw a 2 yard touchdown pass

yards on 21 carries and had three receptions for 46 yards brown contributed 80 yards receiving and 25 yards rushing each scored a touchdown its a great feeling mixon said the vibes are up over here everybodys doing whatever they can to contribute to the team and i feel like everybodys playing complementary football defense steps up statistically the cincinnati defense is among the worst in the nfl especially against the run but the bengals held the colts to 46 yards rushing and shut out indianapolis in the second half the unit forced two turnovers and sacked minshew three times had two sacks giving him 13 12 for the season a decent joe burrow provided his suite at paycor stadium to browning who invited family and friends from california to watch the game burrow was nice to give us tickets browning said its better than sitting outside were from california and not used to the cold well i am but theyre not injuries browning went to the locker room with muscle cramps in his

race browning won his third straight start and improved to 3 1 since burrow suffered a season ending right wrist injury in a loss at baltimore this time he threw for 184 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter and overtime becoming to throw for at least that many yards and two or more scores after three quarters i feel like i need a beer said browning who beat a team that cut him from its practice squad two years ago went high over a vikings defender to catch a 16 yard pass from browning and with 39 seconds left in regulation then in overtime a scrambling browning found for a 44 yard completion that got cincinnati 8 6 into vikings territory and set up s game ending 29 yard field goal jakes just so steady you know bengals coach zac taylor said he really is he doesnt get rattled by a negative play he doesnt overreact to it browning was 29 for 42 for 324 yards with two touchdowns   and an interception he completed passes to 11 receivers and in his four starts  the fourth quarterback to start a game this season for the vikings was solid in defeat but threw two interceptions an absolute grind of a football game mullens said but those are the types of games you want to be in minnesota 7 7 has lost three of four the only win in that stretch a 3 0 decision at las vegas that led to being benched in favor of mullens who had more success finding the vikings playmakers had six catches for 111 yards and two tds had seven receptions for 84 yards in his first full game since returning from a hamstring injury he suffered a chest injury in the raiders game nick did a

yards and a touchdown for minnesota chandler got the start in place of  who has a sprained ankle with five teams a half game behind them in the nfc standings the vikings could be out of playoff

browning go from their practice squad in 2021 the bengals picked him up for their practice squad and he won the job as burrows backup before this season i think right after we made the field goal and won the game i screamed at camera and said they never should have cut me browning said late game heroics browning took over the game late in the third quarter throwing seven straight completions

tied the game at 17 all minnesota pushed back in front on addisons second td catch of the game before browning and higgins found a way to tie it higgins finished with four catches for 61 yards all i can say is we always count on tee higgins taylor said tee stepped up big for us and those were two big touchdowns that he scored for us at the end of the game and he also made some bigger catches

the steelers posted their highest point total in a win since 2020 i felt like we were balanced and we were clicking said rudolph who completed 17 of 27 passes for 290 yards that feeling has been rare for pittsburgh even before ben roethlisbergers retirement after the 2021 season the steelers have spent the last three years relying heavily on a defense that would find ways to win tight games with the offense mostly along for the ride rudolph spent the overwhelming majority of that time on the sideline with a headset on or a clipboard in his hand feeling a bit like a freeloader the 28 year old knew opportunities to prove himself were running out one of the reasons he couldnt sleep before practice on tuesday there was no sleepless night on friday maybe because rudolph felt prepared he

including a just before halftime that set up a field goal  and afterward apologized sort of for saying during the week that his critics were media guys who never played the game yet he also said he was keeping receipts and called the negativity thats engulfed the steelers so much outside noise people like to question our commitment a lot pickens said but that just shows you who we are the path for pittsburgh to reach the playoffs remains complicated  and who knows what will happen at seattle next week when pickett could be ready to return from right ankle surgery  but the steelers first sweep of the bengals since 2019 made it a little more navigable cincinnati 8 7 is still in the mix too but fell to 3 2 as a starter in place of the injured  the longtime practice squad player threw

yards passing and a touchdown and ran for a career best 130 yards to help kansas city 10 6 secure the no 3 seed for the playoffs obviously were not winning this in week 12 or week 13 like before we had to battle through adversity and find a way to win said mahomes who went over 4000 yards passing for his sixth consecutive year as the starter now youre in the playoffs its one game single elimination and i think we can play with anybody the bengals 8 8 fighting to avoid postseason elimination led by 10 early but found themselves trailing 25 17 when butker hit the last of his field

knew would happen happened you have to give kansas city credit they got it done down the stretch the bengals and chiefs are accustomed to playing high stakes games when the weather turns frigid meeting for down to the wire nail biters in each of the past two afc championship games and they are usually accompanied by plenty of trash talk be it from fans elected officials or  in the case this past week  players such as bengals wide receiver  the animosity usually spills onto the field too midway through the second quarter chase and chiefs cornerback got into a heated argument and eventually a team wide scrum resulted in offsetting personal foul penalties i just be under peoples skin sometimes i guess chase said afterward just trash talking he cant handle it the bengals jumped ahead 10 7 when an 8 12 minute drive resulted in a field goal and a 6 12 minute march ended in mixons touchdown catch cincinnati then got the ball back when ran right around rookie right tackle  stripped mahomes from behind and was there to pounce on the loose ball pass interference on sneed in the end zone set up brownings 1 yard td run it wasnt the smoothest early chiefs coach andy reid said butkers first field goal got the chiefs within 17 10 though and they had a chance to take the lead when mahomes saw wide open on their next possession but yet another dropped pass  the nfl leading 40th by kansas city this season  forced the chiefs to settle for another field goal to trail 17 13 at the break but as the chiefs defense stiffened in the second half their offense began showing signs of life they stuffed the bengals on fourth and 1 at the kansas city 6 then drove 82 yards for butkers third field goal and when the bengals had to punt again mahomes hit for 67 yards to set up butkers chip shot and give the chiefs the lead two more field goals gave them some breathing room in the closing minutes everybody contributed in this which i think was great nobody gave up hope said reid whose ninth consecutive 10 win season moved him past the 49ers george seifert for the second longest such streak in nfl history the guys executed well and that is the most important thing right now at this time of year injuries cincinnati wr left in the second quarter with a hamstring injury he returned to the game but didnt have another catch finishing with one for 19 yards

performance  3 of 3 for 12 yards 20 yards rushing  was far better than his preseason debut a year ago when he completed just one pass at jacksonville just days before being suspended by the nfl i wouldnt say satisfied because we didnt get into the end zone he said but it was exactly what the coaching staff wanted us to do washingtons  who is trying to hold onto his starting job threw a 26 yard touchdown pass to and had a few other nice moments in his two series he finished 9 of 12 for 77 yards howell was replaced by brissett who went 4 7 in 11 starts for cleveland in 2022 while watson was out the 30 year old scampered 12 yards for a score in the second quarter to put the commanders 1 0 ahead 14 2 when he came in brissett received a loud ovation from cleveland fans that was awesome he

and all the other stuff thats left in 2022 im focused on 2023 and making sure that im ready for september 10 the season opener watsons got some new weapons and he quickly connected with one throwing a

commanders did have a bit of a turbulent week rivera had to clarify his remarks after making headlines by saying some players had expressed concern over first year offensive coordinator eric bieniemys fiery style that all seems in the past now i thought his play calling was really good rivera said about bieniemy i love his positivity when hes talking to the quarterback he would call a play and tell them hey this should work lets go get it i just love the way he does that kicking mad clevelands had his second miss of the preseason pushing a 46 yarder right in the third quarter he missed a 49

eventually settled down leading cleveland to touchdowns on his next two drives before the chiefs rallied behind a host of backups for a 33 32 victory in their preseason finale it was good for us to be able to deal with some adversity early on said watson who is coming off a disappointing six game stint a year ago which followed an 11 game suspension for violating the nfls personal conduct policy we made some plays overall and we kind of moved the ball we had guys touch the ball and things like that that includes the defense where the browns got pick 6s from and in taking a 29 16 lead after the

this one painful in multiple ways the steelers star linebackers combined for a scoop and score midway through the fourth quarter to pull out an improbable 26 22 victory on monday night the steelers extended their regular season home winning streak against their afc north rivals to 20 and counting in a victory overshadowed by a serious left knee injury to cleveland star running back  the four time pro bowlers sixth nfl season ended two plays into the second quarter after the knee bent awkwardly when he was hit low by steelers safety  he went to the hospital as a precaution before returning to cleveland we feel for nick as a person browns coach kevin stefanski said hes a great football player as we know and an even better person we will support him every step of the way even with their leader sidelined the browns were protecting a three point lead and facing second and 9 at their own 20 with 706 remaining when watt and highsmith went to work the two longtime teammates sensed a play action pass was coming so they widened their stance a little bit in an effort to get a better attack angle off the edge highsmith  who began the night with a 30 yard pick 6 on the first offensive snap  blew past browns left tackle jedrick wills and chopped the ball out of deshaun watsons hands as the cleveland quarterback ran to his right the browns fourth and final turnover ended up in the hands of watt who ran untouched across the goal line before high stepping in celebration splash watt said i think thats what we talk about is creating splash as a defense and the browns went splat an annual event in pittsburgh for two decades save for a breathtaking upset in the first round of the 2020 playoffs cleveland hoped that victory would serve as the start of something instead its been more of the same the browns have failed to reach the postseason each of the last two years and now must find a way forward without one of their unquestioned leaders  chubbs replacement ran for 106 yards and caught a 3 yard touchdown pass but clevelands miscues cost it a chance to win at pittsburgh in the regular season for the first time since 2003 watson completed 22 of 40 for 235 yards with a touchdown and an interception he was also flagged twice for unsportsmanlike conduct for grabbing the facemask of a steeler while running the penalties cut a pair of promising drives short the browns were penalized eight times for 81 yards and turned it over four times two of which ended with a member of one of the best edge rusher tandems in the nfl celebrating in the end zone the steelers avoided their first 0 2 start since 2019 even though their offense continued to sputter connected on 15 of 30 passes for 222 yards a third of them coming on a 71 yard catch and run touchdown by in the second quarter that briefly brought the acrisure stadium crowd to life cleveland still appeared to be in good position when ford raced 69 yards to set up a 1 yard dive by pierre strong that put the browns ahead 22 19 midway through the third quarter pittsburghs offense did next to nothing for most of the second half leading to chants from the crowd to fire coordinator matt canada highsmiths bull rush off the edge and watts scoop and score bailed the steelers out making them the second team since 1991 to win a game they were trailing in the fourth quarter despite having negative yardage in the quarter were not going to apologize for winning pittsburgh coach mike tomlin said maybe but there is plenty to work on the steelers needed multiple defensive touchdowns  the first time theyve done in a game since a 23 7 win over tennessee in 2010  to survive thats not repeatable on a weekly basis pittsburgh will worry about that later monday night was about finding a way the way the steelers always seem to find a way at home when the browns are on the other side of the field its special coming out and just having the performance that we did highsmith said but we were far from perfect we

as the browns rolled to a 27 3 win over the titans on sunday six days after the browns 2 1 were gutted by seeing chubb the heart and soul of the team carted off in tears with a severe knee injury at pittsburgh garrett and clevelands defense stepped up with a dominant performance that overwhelmed the titans 1 2 the browns offense did its part as well with bouncing back from two subpar performances to start the season with his best day since signing with cleveland watson completed 27 of 33 passes for 289 yards  his 43 yarder to putting the browns up 27 3 in the fourth quarter other than an ill advised pitch while being harassed watson was on target thats deshaun thats who he is said cooper who had 116 yards on seven catches hes just going to continue to amaze us all every week as difficult as it was to lose chubb watson said the browns were inspired by seeing him back at the teams facility this week there was of course a little sadness and disappointment on his face watson said but at the same time he looked every single one of us in our eyes he told me go get it because i need it and not just for himself but just for this team this organization so there was no doubt in mind that were going to come out here and play good  who moved into chubbs starting spot had two touchdowns  a 19 yard reception from watson in the second quarter  tennessee has never had a worse day on offense it was the fewest yards for the titans since they relocated from houston in 1997 the previous low was 98 against jacksonville in 2006 the browns held tennessee all pro running back to 20 yards on 11 carries forced the titans to punt seven times in nine possessions and held them to six first downs it was so one sided that on tennessees lone scoring drive  capped by a 44 yard field goal from  the titans lost 9 yards when you play like that and when you coach like that in this league you get your butt beat titans coach mike vrabel said plain and simple its disappointing tannehill was under siege all game he was sacked five times completed 13 of 25 passes for 104 yards and never got tennessees offense moving garrett set the tone from the start with the titans driving for a possible score before halftime garrett sacked tannehill on the final play of the half  a fitting finish for an attacking defense unleashed by first year coordinator jim schwartz who spent the past two seasons as an advisor with the titans on friday garrett conducted his weekly news conference while eating a sandwich wrap it was merely an appetizer clevelands all pro end devoured the titans particularly left tackle  on the last play of the half garrett sped around dillard and was still being blocked when he grabbed and took down tannehill when myles do that hes the best player in the world watson said we believe that and we know that we see it every day in practice and we see it every day on sunday he wanted to show that hes the best guy in the world at that position garretts sack effectively ended the game but ford helped end any doubts with his td run in the third quarter that put the browns up 20 3 an exclamation point for clevelands defense came on the first two plays of the fourth when and garrett recorded sacks on consecutive plays much to the delight of schwartz who smiled on the sideline watsons td pass to ford came after clevelands quarterback took a shot to the head from linebacker  who was called for roughing the passer on the same play the titans were penalized for pass interference watson was checked by trainers but stayed in and connected four plays later with ford at that point the browns had outgained the titans 117 2 quick whistle the browns had what should have been a touchdown taken away in the first half when field judge jeff shears ruled cooper stepped out of bounds after a catch however cooper who may have gotten away with a push never touched the cleveland sideline the play is not reviewable and the browns settled for a 52 yard field goal by  i got robbed of a touchdown cooper said smiling i knew i didnt step out money man tennessees extended his streak of catching at least one pass to 148 games he has caught a pass in every game in his career and his run is the longest active streak in the league injuries titans backup rb and special teamer left leg was injured on tennessees first punt he was unable to put any weight on his leg while being

six seconds remaining giving the an unexpected 19 17 win on sunday i dont think we deserved to win said 49ers star defensive end  we didnt underestimate them but they did play better than us we havent

against san francisco cleveland pulled off the upset without quarterback  who missed his second straight game with a bruised right shoulder the 49ers 5 1 came in looking nearly unbeatable after destroying dallas 42 10 at home last week and scoring at least 30 points in each of their first five games but clevelands top ranked defense was more than up to the task and the 49ers were short handed in the second half without playmakers and a who both went out with injuries pj walker came off clevelands practice squad and outplayed purdy who threw his first interception this season finished with just 125 yards and nearly pulled off a stirring comeback in the final moments before moodys failed kick the 23 year old purdy had been perfect in his pro career winning his first 10

44  well below his league leading average 721 coming in i didnt play at the standard that i needed to purdy said we feel like we failed our own expectations i just have to be better and make the throws man its the nfl when you get opportunities youve got to take care of them there are plays that we didnt make despite being without mccaffrey and samuel purdy made a couple big throws on san franciscos final drive and positioned the ball in the middle of the field for moody who pushed his attempt to the right its on me said moody who missed a 54 yard in the first half ive got to make these kicks in these situations thats what i signed up for at my position the team fought really hard to give me a chance it was a perfect snap perfect hold i just didnt hit it the way i wanted to when the ball sailed into the net and browns fans danced in the aisles after seeing the home team finally catch a few breaks the truth is were a good football team browns coach kevin stefanski said were not perfect we know that but we fought like crazy and im just proud of so many guys the 49ers were heavy favorites at the start of the week and their odds only grew when the browns ruled out watson on friday they turned to walker who was only signed in august and the 28 year old showed poise on clevelands final drive  and got away with a questionable throw into the end zone  to set up hopkins for the winner the browns were also helped with a roughness call on 49ers safety  who spent four seasons with cleveland on 3rd and 10 walkers throw for was high but gipson was called for the personal foul for leading with his helmet my view was his intent wasnt at all to do that 49ers coach kyle shanahan said it looked like the receiver was coming in there jumping too it looked like they touched helmets from where i was it didnt look that violent purdy was out of sync most of the afternoon and things got even tougher for the second year qb when samuel went out with a shoulder injury

team history cooper set a franchise record with 265 yards receiving and scored two touchdowns and a 2 point conversion and the browns beat the 36 22 to move closer to a playoff berth not to disrespect their defensive backs but everything was flowing well and it kind of seemed a little easy he said coopers performance moved him atop the browns record book ahead of  who had 261 yards receiving against jacksonville on dec 1 2013 it was also the most receiving yards in an nfl game this season cooper has 1250 yards making him the first receiver in team history with consecutive 1000 yard seasons it was his third 200 yard receiving game and he joins terrell owens as the only players to do it with three teams cooper had a 226 yard game with the cowboys and a 210 yard game for the raiders the browns cant clinch a playoff spot this week but at 10 5 theyre all but guaranteed to secure just their second postseason appearance since 2002 its the third time since 1999 that theyve reached double digit wins doing so in 2007 and 2020 a win thursday against the will punch their ticket to the playoffs i cant wait  we can earn it on thursday coach kevin stefanski said threw for 368 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions in his fourth start for the browns who built a 22 7 halftime lead and cruised to their third straight victory cooper who had td catches of 75 and 7 yards credited flacco for his success to be completely candid i would attribute most of it to joe he said he has an incredible feel for the game he has an incredible arm  the best way of explaining it is that we mesh well together houstons playoff hopes took a blow as the texans fell to 8 7 on a day when threw for just 62 yards with two interceptions in his second start in place of star rookie  whos recovering from a concussion keenum was replaced by late in the third quarter we just didnt do enough today the 35 year old keenum said we got our butts kicked and thats never fun i hadnt had it like that in a while after squeaking out a 19 16 overtime win at tennessee last week houston struggled from the start sunday and the team didnt score on offense until the fourth quarter houston coach demeco ryans knows the offense must do more but was more disappointed in his defense when you dont get pressure on the quarterback no matter whos out there its going to be a long day he said flacco had a really good day against us we didnt pressure him at all he stood back in the pocket he had all day to throw the football and we werent where we were supposed to be in coverage the browns took an early lead when took a direct snap and scored on a 4 yard run on the first possession cooper made it 14 0 with his early in the second quarter hes special flacco said we were able to get him open down the field but he was also able to go up for some balls and be strong through the catch and all that stuff cut the lead to seven points when  pierce in his first action as a returner got a couple of early blocks before outrunning the rest of the defense for houstons second kick return score of the season kicker  who attempted to chase down pierce during the run left after that with a hamstring injury and the browns didnt attempt an extra point or field goal the rest of the game stefanski didnt have an update on hopkins after the game except to say that hell have an mri the browns extended their lead on a 21 yard td reception by with about four minutes left in the first half backup qb ran for the 2 point conversion to make it 22 7 flacco connected with cooper again on a 7 yard td with about 2 12 minutes left in the third quarter but the 2 point conversion failed picked keenum off soon after coopers second score clevelands defense celebrated the turnover by running to the end zone and pretending to make snow angels the offense got in the end zone again on the next drive when scored on a 1 yard run cooper caught the 2 point conversion pass to put the browns ahead 36 7 mills the starter for most of the last two seasons cut the lead to 36 15 when he finally got the texans into the end zone on a td pass and 2 point conversion to  houston recovered an onside kick and added

to win the afc north and maybe the conferences no 1 overall seed something that seemed unfathomable just weeks ago as major injuries piled up but things have changed since flacco arrived the 38 year old quarterback improved to 4 1 as a starter with the browns who plucked the super bowl 47 mvp off his couch in new jersey last month to hopefully rescue their season hes done that and more in the final minutes browns fans chanted flac co flac co to a quarterback they once reviled with baltimore and now revere you dont know how many of these moments youre going to get flacco said im going to remember this for the rest of my life flacco threw two td passes to in the first half as the browns built a 20 point lead over the jets 6 10 who chose not to re sign the 15 year veteran after he spent three seasons with them  and after tore his left achilles tendon in week 1 flacco torched new york for 296 yards in the first half and became the first qb in 34 games to go over 300 yards against the jets hes also the first cleveland quarterback to pass for more than 300 in four straight while flacco insisted revenge wasnt on his mind but jets receiver said the qb was out to prove something hes wound like that wilson said he told me at the end of last season he wasnt going to be a backup he was going to play and he held to that joes a great guy the type of teammate you want he deserves everything the atmosphere was electric from the start inside stadium as fans who have felt mostly heartbreak for decades got a chance to celebrate it was special flacco said this is obviously a unique

this season for the browns who have continued to win despite being overrun by injuries since the opener flacco is their fourth starting quarterback theyre missing both first team offensive tackles and

big the moment is our whole team is leaning on him and he has the shoulders to carry that weight stroud the second overall pick in the draft last april is also the highest drafted rookie qb to win in the postseason he picked apart clevelands vaunted defense throwing touchdown passes of 15 yards to  76 to and 37 to  its been a heck of a year and i thank god i can just go another week with my teammates stroud said this is like a dream come true at 22 years and 102 days old stroud passed michael vick who was 22 years 192 days old in 2002 when his falcons beat the packers im super blessed to be considered with a great name like michael vick who was my favorite quarterback growing up he said and hopefully i can make it two wins stroud threw for 236 yards and three touchdowns before

bad day to have a bad day stefanksi said thats all of us thats players coaches offense defense special teams not good enough playing in his 17th postseason game but first in nine years flacco couldnt continue his magical run under the bright lights of the playoffs its definitely a shame the way it went down and hard to deal with at the moment flacco said he finished with 307 yards and had a touchdown pass in the first half but his mistakes under pressure in the third quarter were too much for the browns to overcome on a day when stroud easily outshined him in his playoff debut the previous highest drafted rookie qb to win a postseason game was the  mark sanchez who was the fifth overall pick in 2009 clevelands was under center for the texans during their last playoff run but played just six games for the browns this season before having season ending shoulder surgery he was on the sideline saturday for just the second time since his surgery watching the coming out party

things that i really carry with me as a tight end strouds 37 yard td pass to schultz pushed the lead to 24 14 with about a minute left in the second quarter flacco was hit by as he threw and his pass was picked off to make it 31 14 with about six minutes left in the third quarter the browns went for it on fourth and 2 on their next drive and flacco was picked off again this time  the texans are

to answer questions about his first nfl action in almost two years any extended insight into how the jacksonville receiver feels about working with his new quarterback in a game will have to wait ridley had two catches in his return from an absence lengthened by a yearlong gambling suspension and responded to an interception with a touchdown pass in a 28 23 victory over the in a preseason opener saturday playing against mostly dallas backup defenders ridley had a short catch on jacksonvilles second series then a first down grab on the third possession before a it felt good to get back out on that field today with my teammates ridley said in a statement issued by the team after the game im excited about the direction were headed as an offense and as a team lawrences td toss was set up by a fumble on a punt return from  who a year ago essentially made the roster with the cowboys by returning a kickoff and a punt for scores in the same preseason game obviously its such a small sample size lawrence said its different when you play a full game and you get different looks and you kind of progress as the game goes and you kind of get settled in i thought he did a great job it was the first game for ridley since oct 24 2021 with atlanta playing through a broken left foot that season he stepped away to address his mental health following a home robbery ridley was suspended for the 2022 season because he bet on the nfl while away from the falcons the jaguars traded two draft picks to get ridley last november and hes been the teams most dynamic player so far in training camp he caught 90 passes for 1374 yards and nine touchdowns in 2020 when ridley said he played most of the season with that broken foot the qbs behind lawrence and  had a short td run apiece in the fourth quarter when he escaped two defenders and was in the arms of a third while throwing a 21 yard scoring pass to  dallas third stringer had two touchdown passes a a second year receiver trying to get into the rotation after a quiet rookie season jacksonville played its starters on the first two offensive series and it ended up being three after turpins fumble was recovered by at the dallas 42 yard line ridleys second catch was a 13 yarder for a first down and lawrences 9 yard scoring toss to kirk came on fourth and 3 lawrence was 5 of 6 for 36 yards 21 of them going to ridley the first jacksonville series ended when lawrence threw deep while rolling to his left and undrafted second year safety made the catch in front of  the cowboys didnt play quarterback or any other projected starters on offense in coach mike mccarthys return to play calling the closest thing was right guard  who is filling in for with the six time all pro holding out of training camp in a contract dispute play it back mccarthy called the plays for the first time since midseason in 2018 when he was green bays coach while he said it was like riding a bike mccarthy did call for strong right that play was in his packers playbook not this one personally im glad i have a number of coaches that worked with me before mccarthy said we got it corrected right away go for it the jags apparently didnt need to see kicker  who was signed in may after he was waived by denver mcmanus spent his first nine seasons with the broncos jacksonville went for 2 point conversions after all four tds two passes were caught and two were incomplete deuce on the loose dallas rookie sixth round draft pick had a solid debut with 50 yards on eight carries all in the second half the 5 foot 5 running back had a 26 yard run and a catch for a third down conversion before a 4 yard run that gave the cowboys their only lead at 16 14 another rookie runner jacksonvilles  a third round pick had a 34 yard run two plays before  42 yard catch on the drive that ended with beathards scoring run bigsby had 52 yards on nine carries still a pat problem dallas kicker  a 28 year old rookie from the usfl and former pro soccer player kicked a 29 yard field goal in his debut before missing his first point attempt he made the second aubrey is the only kicker on the roster at the moment the cowboys decided to move on from

start to finish seattle coach pete carroll said we got the starters a little bit of work you know selective starters played on both sides of the ball and got enough to just get them out there smith had two drives behind his starting offensive line and the second possession ended in a 57 yard field goal from  smith was 5 of 6 for 46 yards in his limited action lock took over in the second quarter and continued to show the seahawks would be in good hands if they need their backup lock was 5 of 6 for 119 yards including a 48 yard strike to first rounder that set up deejay dallas 1 yard td run

backs would be closely watched in the preseason finale we got to make sure we get a really good evaluation particularly this upcoming week against the raiders because this young group has a chance to be pretty good mccarthy said but dallas would get no closer was 13 of 18 for 136 yards but was by seattles two plays into the fourth quarter brown got extensive play time after major injuries left him sidelined for most of the past two seasons on fourth and 3 at the seattle 28 inside the final two minutes when i threw the ball i thought it was a touchdown to be honest just werent on the same page with the receiver i thought i played great grier said backup seattle wide receiver also  the two teams will see each other later in the season on a thursday night in late november in texas seattle

the field under his own power before riding a cart to the locker room overshown was a third round pick out of texas offensive tackle shoulder te john stephens knee and s hamstring also didnt return we had a couple young guys go down and you just say your prayers and hopefully the imaging points in the right direction mccarthy said bad penalty dallas s was called for taunting after seattle went

fill his third string role by acquiring in a trade with san francisco with prescott in his ear grier completed 29 of 35 passes with two tds and ran for 54 yards with two more scores in a likely dallas swan song after two seasons behind backup  and not taking a snap in the regular season owner jerry jones said grier was emotional before the game knowing what the lance trade meant for his future grier confirmed as much after the game pausing several times to collect himself while answering questions from reporters the hardest part on me is just leaving this place to be honest grier said got really close with the team thats the toughest part about what we do ive been through harder things and ill rebound and be just fine had a 24 yard touchdown runa for the raiders who were playing a few hours after nfl rushing champion ended his contract stalemate by agreeing to a one year deal the loss ended a six game preseason winning streak for las vegas which was tied with pittsburgh for the nfls longest after baltimores record 24 game run ended at washington last week after griers 15 yard scoring pass to rookie running back for a 21 10 lead late in the first half prescott pumped his fists the same he way does after his own tds and celebrated with offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer and coach mike mccarthy when the game was over prescott was more subdued pointing out that his thoughts were with grier as he answered questions about the addition of lance its a tough situation honestly prescott said love that guy to death over there were going to welcome trey and thats what you do for a teammate im a very selfless person so thats not going to change by any means but my hearts with that guy over there right now grier whose only two regular season games came as a rookie with carolina in 2019 took every snap for the cowboys with rush entrenched in the role behind prescott the starters sat for both teams including quarterback a week after his las vegas debut almost every dallas starter didnt play at all in the preseason many who saw extensive action have tenuous roster situations similar to griers including williams six carries 54 yards and dallas running back 10 carries 42 yards the cowboys sat and rookie  an indication they are filling the two spots behind lead back  the same was true for the raiders who rested and after they spent all of training camp in the top two spots while jacobs stayed away still williams left a strong final impression hes a pro very physical coach josh mcdaniels said just brings a tough mindset and attitude a guy that brings some value to your football team in other ways as well fits in with our culture had a couple of really nice plays tonight which was great to see by the numbers third string las vegas qb was 17 of 26 for 178 yards and had 10 catches for 122 yards luepke who was lances teammate at north dakota state had 118 scrimmage yards 58 rushing 60 receiving getting their kicks barring a late change the

opening 40 0 victory sunday night its the first game cowboys quarterback said thats yalls job to write whatever statement it needs to be for us its about not getting ahead of ourselves continuing to stay disciplined to show the discipline not only what we did through these four quarters but taking that and making sure we use it throughout our preparation this week scored on two short touchdown

giants shutout loss was the largest between the teams topping the cowboys 35 0 win in 1995 also in a season opener in the meadowlands it was also the cowboys biggest shutout victory in any game topping their 38 0 win over the baltimore colts in 1978 i saw this before anybody cowboys edge rusher said i said i cant wait to get to new york i knew it was coming with execution meets preparation there is no one that can beat it weve already felt this weve been to war before we knew the standard this was supposed to be the game that showed whether the giants had closed the gap on dallas and defending nfc champion philadelphia in the nfc east enough said the cowboys didnt need much from prescott and the offense they got two field goals from new kicker and pollard got dallas first td on offense on a 2 yard run midway through the second quarter to push the advantage to 26 0 at halftime the halftime shutout margin was the fourth most lopsided in week 1 for a home team topped only by

his way to scoring after aubrey kicked a 21 yard field goal bland scored on the ensuing series cornerback hit barkley while the running back caught a swing pass the ball popped in the air and bland caught it and scored the game was never close after that just to show how bad the giants played gano missed a 36 yarder with 105 left in the half leaving coach brian daboll shaking his head daboll offered no excuses after the game and gave credit to dallas im focused on trying to improve and theres a lot to improve said the second year head coach who led new york to the playoffs last season its

hounded all night and the 49ers extended their dominance over the with a 42 10 victory sunday it felt good especially going against the no 1 defense in the league star left tackle said obviously thats a big test for week 5 of the year i think we pass that test with flying colors but were going to get tested again the niners 5 0 knocked the cowboys in tight games the past two seasons adding intrigue to this early season matchup between perceived contenders the rematch wasnt even close the niners led 14 0 before the cowboys got their initial first down of the night and were never really threatened on the way to matching a franchise record with their 15th straight regular season win and earning their fifth 5 0 start i knew it was our biggest game so far this year as far as nationally and just media wise and the hype coach kyle shanahan said sometimes you worry your team can get too up for stuff  they were so locked in all week they didnt make too big a deal of this game and were ready to go purdy calmly picked apart the leagues stingiest defense to improve to 10 0 as a starter in the nfl and san franciscos defense made life difficult on prescott all night prescott was sacked three times and heaved an interception into double coverage after dallas fell behind 28 10 in the third quarter he threw two more interceptions in the fourth quarter with his only highlight coming on a 26 yard td pass to in the second quarter we see the talent in the room and what our potential is but its about doing it week in and week out said linebacker  who had a sack an interception and a forced fumble to do it this game on this stage against a really good football team it really meant a lot it was dallas most lopsided defeat since losing 49 17 to new orleans in 2013 didnt see it coming prescott said put everything into this and got punched in the mouth it was humbling a couple weeks ago against arizona but this may be the most humbling game ive ever been a part of purdy again was nearly  a week after throwing only one incomplete pass in a win over arizona he repeatedly found openings downfield to  and especially kittle purdy finished 17 for 24 for 252 yards and has not thrown an interception all season he connected on a 19 yard td pass to kittle on the opening drive a 38 yarder early in the second quarter on a and then a 10 yarder to put the game away in the third quarter the defense does their job so it makes life easy for me purdy said kittle became the first niners player with three td catches in a game since vernon davis in 2009 purdy added a 1 yard td pass to in the fourth quarter and the rest of the game was merely garbage time with mostly backups you have to learn how to take a punch cowboys edge rusher said we got punched in the face tonight and thats just the reality of it im not shying from it we got beat up in all phases and thats the reality fast starters the niners took the opening kick and drove 75 yards in seven plays to score on a 19 yard pass from purdy to kittle to take the lead san francisco has four tds and one field goal on the opening drive this season for a league leading 31 points the 49ers were just as tough on defense early holding dallas to 6 yards in the first quarter and no first downs for more than 17 minutes scoring streak scored on a 1 yard run in the second quarter after losing a fumble near the goal line earlier in the game it was the he has scored a td in the regular season or playoffs the only players in nfl history with longer streaks are lenny moore 17 games oj simpson 15 and john riggins 15 get tricky shanahan said the niners had the reverse flea flicker in the game plan for a while but had only used it once in the nfc title game last year when mccaffrey was the quarterback on the play they did a walkthrough of the play this week that started with a handoff to mccaffrey who handed to samuel on a reverse before the flea flicker to purdy shanahan got encouragement from watching detroit score on

his eight year career last week and with a bye week on the horizon prescott went into monday nights game against the knowing anything other than victory would be detrimental to the cowboys hopes of contending for an nfc title prescott responded by throwing for 272 yards and a touchdown as dallas rallied in the fourth quarter for a 20 17 victory it was a must win theres a big difference between 4 2 and 3 3 said prescott who completed 21 of 30 passes and also had a rushing td we talked after last week about not allowing this thing to landslide when you get this win like we did we can definitely move on the cowboys  coming off a 42 10 loss at san francisco on oct 8  continue to prove they dont let losses fester they improved to 10 1 in weeks following a loss since the start of the 2021 season theres plays that needed to be made especially down the stretch cowboys coach mike mccarthy said a lot of back and forth a lot of resetting your jaw and just keep fighting and i thought our men did a really good job there prescott became the 30th quarterback in nfl history to throw at least one touchdown pass against 31 or more opponents when he connected with for a 2 yard scorea with 1119 remaining in the game to give the cowboys a 17 10 lead dak did a lot of great things said cowboys receiver  who had seven receptions for 117 yards he improvised a lot gave us the ability to do our work down the field prescott showed off his running ability midway through the first quarter when he faked a handoff on fourth and 1 and to tie the game at 7 7 it was the longest rushing touchdown of prescotts eight year career we had ceedee in motion as an option the defensive end took out tony and two other guys ran toward ceedee just allowing me to cut up field said prescott who also had 40 rushing yards on seven carries i have not been showing my legs early in the year so that might have played a part in it los angeles tied it at 17 with 711 remaining when caught a 1 yard touchdown passa from  made two field goals including a 39 yarder with 219 remaining to give the cowboys the lead the chargers 2 3 had one last chance to send it into overtime or win but picked off herbert at the la 33 yard line with 122 remaining to seal the victory on the play immediately before the pick herbert was sacked by for an 8 yard loss we fell short and ive got to make more plays as a quarterback said herbert who was 22 of 37 for 227 yards with two touchdowns and an interception i missed a couple of receivers threw some bad passes there was a lot left out there so theres a lot to work on and a lot to improve on the chargers started off well when they scored on their opening drive for the second straight game as allen caught a 1 yard pass from herbert on third and goal allen finished with seven catches for 85 yards los angeles had a chance to tie or take the lead on the opening drive of the third quarter but herbert was unable to complete it to in the end zone on fourth and 1 at the cowboys 7 i thought we were really good most of the night on third down i thought we pressured the quarterback at a high level but dak made a couple of plays on that last drive and it hurt us chargers coach brandon staley said key play cooks touchdown was set up by a on the first play of the fourth quarter prescott scrambled out of pressure on third and 11 at the dallas 24 and completed a short pass to pollard at the 32 pollard then spun out of a tackle by chargers cornerback at the 40 and appeared as if he would score a touchdown until he was brought down by asante samuel at the chargers 16 the throw to pollard is one of those fluke plays off the scramble where we have him and you give credit to dak for making a big play staley said lucky bounce the chargers tied it in the fourth quarter when they took over on the cowboys 20 after a muffed punt dallas thought got his hand on the ball but tolbert was the first to touch it he fumbled and chargers linebacker recovered it it was originally called a downed punt but it was reversed after the chargers challenged the call injuries chargers dl suffered a knee injury on the first play of the game but came back in the

another tush push score to lead the over the 28 23 on sunday night the eagles are the only 8 1 team in the nfl the eagles did all they could on dallas final drive to cough up the game needed to move the cowboys 86 yards in 46 seconds for the potential winning score  and promptly got 56 yards of eagles penalties to reach the 6 yard line on the cusp of a stunning comeback prescott instead was

a significant injury to hurts hurts has downplayed the severity of the condition of his knee and scoffed at all questions  including when exactly he was hurt hes yet to even show up on the injury report id do anything for my city my teammates hurts said it takes what it takes hurts suffered a scare in the final minutes of the first half he was hit by defensive lineman and wrapped for a sack by linebacker  hurts stumbled as he stood up and appeared in pain as he limped off the field hurts took a moment on the sideline to collect himself when the eagles called timeout the 2022 nfl mvp runner up hurts remained in the game for a handoff his teammates continue to respect hurts resilience if he can get up and walk off hes ok wide receiver said he said a couple of words then right after hes all laughing and joking the score the banged up knee all of it seemed to only push hurts on the opening drive of the third to prove he could be as dangerous on one gimpy knee as he was on two good legs on the first drive of the third quarter hurts scrambled for four yards and a first down he threw an 11 yard reception and then tossed a pinpoint pass to in the corner of the end zone for a 29 yard score and 21 17 lead hurts hit brown for a 4 yard td and a 28 17 lead in the closing minutes of the quarter brown had had set an nfl record with six straight games with at least 125 yards receiving he had 66 yards to end the streak philadelphias defense took it from there eagles linebacker prevented a score and flipped prescott to the 1 yard line on fourth down prescotts pass to tight end was initially called a touchdown but a replay review showed schoonmakers left knee was down on about the inch line and the td was overturned the linc erupted in cheers  a familiar roar to phillies slugger bryce harper who watched from a suite prescott hit for a 7 yard score to make it 28 23 and the qb scrambled for a 2 point conversion or so he thought again replay reversed a pivotal call for the cowboys and prescotts scramble didnt count the eagles held their five point lead an inch here an inch there and well find a way to gain that prescott said the eagles would need to collapse for the cowboys or any other team in the nfc east to catch them for first place dallas gave it a good run owner jerry jones stayed quiet this week to avoid any bulletin board quotes saying he didnt want to poke the bear precott responded pour honey on me if you see me and a bear in a fight pour honey on me bears maybe birds not so much somersaulted into the end zone for a 12 yard score and a 7 0 eagles lead in the first quarter prescott then threw consecutive td passes a 4 yard tying score to and a 5 yard strike to in the second for a 14 7 lead hurts tied the game with the now familiar  and wildly successful  tush push it was his seventh rushing touchdown of the season six on the tush push he also set an eagles qb rushing record with 33 career touchdowns even on one good knee hurts is

previous high of 55 against the giants  in 1966 obviously we wanted to handle them for the second time this season just happened to be in that manner with that many points unfortunate circumstances for them at quarterback but he made some plays at times good for us the cowboys  whose 640 total yards were 12 shy of the franchise record  had a 54 0 combined first half margin in the two games this

14 in the series and just posted the second most yards allowed in the 97 year history of the giants just getting beat by anybody like that sucks said giants running back  who downplayed having to get a previously injured ankle retaped in the second half i dont think theres more or less because its the dallas cowboys prescott finished 26 of 35 and set a franchise record with his third game of at least 400 yards passing and four tds  all in the first three quarters  while throwing an interception that set up new york at the dallas 12 yard line when the cowboys lead was just 7 0 but barkley and coach brian daboll had a testy exchange  one of several among giants players and coaches on a frustrating day  after a failed fourth down try from the 4 when the star running back was stuffed for no

appendectomy not to worry thanks to his quarterback kicker and opportunistic defense threw for two touchdowns made four field goals to start his career a record 30 for 30 and the cowboys pulled even in the division with their 15th consecutive home victory 33 13 over the eagles on sunday night the cowboys 10 3 werent deterred by s 42 yard fumble returna for a touchdown winning their fifth consecutive game since a loss at philadelphia that gave the eagles a two game division lead dallas owner jerry jones said it was the biggest win in mccarthys four seasons as coach and it has to do with the fact that he came up off the operating table and did not even wince and stand there and fight it all night and coach it jones said the eagles 10 3 lost three fumbles and didnt score an offensive touchdown as quarterback  who had the first fumble lost consecutive games for the first time since october 2021 while the cowboys currently hold the tiebreaker with an extra nfc east victory the defending nfc champion eagles would take the division title on subsequent tiebreakers if they win their remaining four games the roles the same as its always been coach nick sirianni said and now were going through some adversity and so adversity can do a couple of things to you it can break you or it can make it way better aubrey became the first kicker with two field goals of at least 59 yards in the same game late in the first quarter his 59 yarder in the third allowed aubrey to surpass and  who each had a pair from at least 58 yards the 28 year old rookie added two in the fourth quarter from 45 and 50 yards to extend his nfl record for perfection to start a career the previous record was 18 just going out there doing it one at a time said aubrey who grew up in the dallas area and once was a major league soccer prospect i know i can make any of the kicks theyve asked me to do with mccarthy calling plays from the sideline just four days after leaving the facility and ending up in surgery prescott had a career best seventh consecutive game with at least two td passes i just wanted to do my part said mccarthy who is in his first year of calling plays for dallas i wanted to make sure i was prepared as i normally am i was a little nervous about it today were all creatures of habit the dallas offense bogged down after prescotts first half td passes but two big completions for first downs to tight end  early in the fourth quarter led to both of aubreys field goals after the break the cowboys were cruising when prescott lost control of the ball while being sacked by in the third quarter and carter picked up the loose ball and ran untouched to get the eagles within 24 13 down two touchdowns late in the third philadelphia couldnt convert on fourth and 8 from the dallas 30 yard line made the open field tackle on for just a 1 yard gain the fourth down stop was probably the biggest one of the game mccarthy said that was a huge momentum swing in the game i thought our defense was lights out tonight smith later had the last of philadelphias three fumbles ending any realistic hopes for a rally all three fumbles ended promising drives for the eagles who were coming off a 42 19 loss to san francisco it was the same thing two weeks in a row cox said we kind of dug ourselves a hole in the first half it was kind of hard getting our way out i think the biggest thing for this team now is really find out who the dudes are and had the scoring catches for dallas and had a 1 yard plunge that was originally called short but overturned when the cowboys challenged prescott was 24 of 39 for 271 yards and the cowboys limited hurts to 197 yards passing and 30 rushing churning it out ferguson is compiling quite the highlight reel of hurdle plays and now the second year player has consecutive games of at least five catches and at least 70 yards for the first time confidence is through the roof with him prescott said hes a fun guy to play with active will do whatever it takes wants to make the catch wants to jump over guys injuries eagles s was ruled out with a concussion after leaving the game in the first half  cowboys dt sprained an ankle in the third quarter and didnt return up next eagles at seattle on monday dec 18 the seahawks loss at san francisco means philadelphia wont face a team with a winning record in its final four games

report allen said decker didnt report and that his conversation with decker was about skipper reporting video showed allen and decker talking before allen said something to the dallas defense that conversation is where skipper reports to me and i then go to the defensive team and i say to them skipper has reported as an eligible receiver so they will be aware of who has reported allen said in the pool report goff finished 19 for 34 for 271 yards with a td and two interceptions and had a scoring run its unfortunate man goff said i dont know if ive had this feeling before where you feel like you won and then you didnt prescott finished 26 for 38 for 345 yards with an interception lamb broke two of receiver michael irvins single season club records from 1995 while also setting career highs

spoiled sean paytons first game as denvers coach with a 17 16 win over the broncos on sunday it aint got to be pretty youve just got to get it done said as he walked off the field with garoppolo after the raiders stretched their winning streak over their afc west rivals to seven games despite the absence of star pass rusher a whos involved in a feud with the front office that skid hurts even worse to some broncos fans than the 15 game losing streak against and the chiefs kansas city has owned the afc west for seven years while the raiders and broncos have spent that time taking turns as the dregs of the division garoppolo who came to las vegas after six seasons in san francisco and meyers who joined the raiders after four seasons in new england connected 10 times for 81 yards including touchdowns of 3 and 6 yards the second which erased denvers 16 10 lead with 634 remaining followed an end zone interception by broncos safety    hes got great mental toughness love his grit love his toughness raiders coach josh mcdaniels said after taking the lead the raiders held denver to its only three and out and garoppolo got the ball back with about five minutes left and never gave it back jackson was whistled for a 15 yard penalty on the drive when he hit meyers in the head with an elbow after a key catch sending him to the sideline that infraction helped the raiders run out the clock i thought we only had to make one more play than they did mcdaniels said and thats what we did payton returned to the sideline after a years sabbatical in the fox broadcast booth in large part to revive s career after the quarterbacks worst season wilson looked much better than he did last year with nathaniel hackett at the helm completing 27 of 34 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns without an interception wilson only threw for 52 yards in the second half however after tight end knee left and the raiders ramped up their pass rush paytons special teams were the biggest problem for denver there was a costly hold that negated one return a botched onside kick to open the game and two big misses from  paytons reliable kicker in new orleans whom he reacquired in a trade with the saints last month my job is to make points said lutz who was wide right on both the pat and a 55 yard field goal attempt and to lose a game by one and i leave four points on the board i didnt do my job hell bounce back payton said lutzs dismal day brought renewed scrutiny on paytons decision to jettison veteran kicker last spring mcmanus quickly signed with jacksonville and was 5 for 5 on pats and field goals sunday in the jaguars 31 21 win over the colts lutz was good from 24 yards out to push denvers lead to 16 10 midway through the fourth quarter that capped a 16 play 75 yard drive that followed jacksons end zone interception off s tip the pick was a terrible stupid decision said garoppolo who completed 20 of 26 passes for 200 yards without a sack just got to take the points there throw it away when nothings there but you know i thought the mental toughness kicked in and guys stuck with it they believed in me so i appreciate them for that garoppolo rewarded that faith by driving the raiders 75 yards in six plays with the payoff coming on meyers 6 yard td grab and s pat proved the final margin wilsons rebound wilson threw two 5 yard touchdown passes in the first half the first was to wide receiver a another of paytons former saints players on denvers first drive that marked the first time since 2008 at oakland that denver scored a touchdown on its first drive of the season wilsons 5 yard strike to with 18 seconds left in the second quarter gave denver a 13 10 halftime lead wilson retreated to the locker room having completed 17 of 19 passes  with one of the misses being a clock stopping spike  for 125 yards i feel great wilson said the only thing thats disappointing is we didnt come up with a win tonight led denver with 52 yards on 13 rushes in his first

 preserving the commanders come from behind win washington rallied from an early 21 3 deficit to take a 35 24 lead then had to hang on with no time on the clock cbs rules analyst gene steratore said it looked like st juste made enough early contact for a foul but brad rogers crew didnt throw a flag and the commanders celebrated the franchises first 2 0 start since 2011 the broncos 0 2 have lost back to back home games for the first time not the kind of history coach sean payton was hoping to make in his return to the sideline after a year in the broadcast studio following a highly successful 15 year stint in new orleans especially after he criticized predecessor nathaniel hackett for doing one of the worst coaching jobs in nfl history last year the broncos lost despite scoring touchdowns on their first three drives for the first time since 2010 their 18 point blown lead tied for the fourth largest at home in franchise history this is a resilient team washingtons said after throwing for 299 yards and two tds in his first road start the thing im proud of is we had each others back on both sides of the ball  added two td runs helping the commanders to the second biggest comeback in franchise history washington overcame a 21 point deficit to beat detroit on nov 4 1990 the commanders used a 32 3 scoring outburst to take control before the broncos made it interesting at the very end with 2 seconds left and the broncos at the 50 yard line trailing 35 27 wilson heaved a pass toward the end zone that was deflected by a scrum of players before johnson snared it for the score wilson threw for 308 yards and three tds but also had two turnovers the last time denver scored tds on each of its first three drives was on nov 14 2010 against kansas city a game the broncos went on to win 49 29 payton got the ball into his young speedsters hands early on and it paid off with undrafted rookie a scoring on a 5 yard pitch rookie receiver a hauling in a 60 yard touchdown pass and second year wideout snaring a 16 yard score none of the three touched the ball again until mims got a handoff midway through the third quarter with the score tied at 21 mims had two catches for 113 yards on two targets but wasnt thrown to again after denvers third possession and spent much of the rest of the game on the sideline some of its coverage driven and some of it is just based on what were in payton said were in a couple of different personnel groupings so part of that is coincidence i would say we had a number of guys were trying to get the ball to and we will keep doing that mims also had a 45 yard punt return giving him 168 all purpose yards on five touches any time he can touch the football is a good thing for us wilson said celebrations washington coach ron rivera was presented with a game ball in the locker room for his in the nfl and the broncos honored their winning team at halftime jackson ejected the game turned when howell threw a 4 yard touchdown pass to on fourth and goal and safety was ejected for launching himself at the tight end who suffered a concussion on the play and didnt return jackson also drew a 15 yard flag in the opener for a hit he put on raiders receiver  and payton was asked if he felt a suspension was possible gosh i dont have an answer for you he said because those things happen so quickly  from my vantage point i only get to see it one time you look up and they make the call and youve got to go with it with the flag moving the conversion try to the 1 washington went for 2 and pulled within 21 11 when robinson got the ball past the plane s 46 yard field goal as the first half expired made it 21 14 and the commanders erased the final remnants of their 18 point deficit on s 30 yard td grab on their first drive after

broncos 30 with less than a minute left and they were three points shy of breaking the nfls single game scoring record instead of sending out his kicker for a potential record setting field goal dolphins coach mike mcdaniel elected to take a knee and run out the clock it felt like chasing points and chasing a record  thats not what we came to the game to do mcdaniel said they almost got there anyway the dolphins scored the most points in a game by an nfl team since 1966 overwhelming the broncos 70 20 on sunday behind the rookie speedster achanes 203 yards rushing and tua tagovailoas td the dolphins for scoring and finished two points shy of the nfls regular season record  set in 1966 when washington scored 72 points against the giants they are the fourth team in nfl history to score at least 70 points in a regular season or playoff game many of miamis starters including tagovailoa and star receiver  were pulled from the game early in the fourth quarter achane caught a 10 yard td pass from tagovailoa  the quarterbacks fourth td  in the fourth and converted the extra point that made it 56 13 and broke miamis franchise scoring record of 55 set against st louis on nov 24 1977 seventy points is crazy said achane who combined with veteran running back for eight touchdowns thats like video game type stuff hill on miamis opening drive en route to 157 yards receiving on nine catches miami scored touchdowns on eight of nine drives before replaced tagovailoa in the fourth mostert had his second straight multiple touchdown game with three rushing tds and a td catch to be able to put up 70 points i think that is going to put a lot of teams on notice that were nothing to play with mostert said were that team just to put it bluntly tagovailoa found a wide open hill on the dolphins third play of the game for the duos fourth touchdown connection of the season hill had 97 yards of separation from the nearest broncos defender when the pass arrived according to nfl nextgen stats tagovailoa the nfls leading passer looked to his left then flipped a 4 yard pass to achane which gave miami a 21 7 lead in the second tagovailoa completed each of his first 17 pass attempts never done that before in a game tagovailoa said of his no look shovel pass when i did it in practice everyone was like oh that was super cool youve got to do that in the game so thats what i did tagovailoas first incompletion came with 944 left in the third when he slightly underthrew hill he finished one completion shy of miamis franchise record which was set by in 2015 when he completed 18 consecutive passes over a two game span achane averaged 113 yards on 18 carries and had an electric 67 yard touchdown run in the fourth that at 70 he also had a physical 8 yard rushing td in the first that made it 14 0 denvers defense down starting safety hip and linebacker hip got a rare stop with 452 left in the first half when the dolphins could not convert on fourth and 1 at their 34 but the broncos punted on the ensuing drive started a season 0 3 for the first time in his career as denver simply could not keep pace with miamis scoring wilson was 23 of 38 with 306 yards and an interception he had a 12 yard td pass to on denvers second possession it was the second td catch of the season for sutton who led denver with 91 yards on eight catches sunday sutton had two fumbles both of which were knocked out by dolphins safety  the first led to a 3 yard run by mostert that made it 35 10 just before halftime the second resulted in mosterts 19 yard td catch in the third he finished with 82 yards rushing and 60 yards receiving only one coach in broncos history started out worse than first year coach sean payton has at 0 3 and thats miamis defensive coordinator vic fangio who lost his first four games as denvers head coach in 2019 will lutz had kicks of 31 and 25 yards for denver and rookie  returned a kickoff 99 yards for a score in the fourth obviously that was embarrassing and tough to watch payton said aside from the kick return there werent a lot of positives to take from that game  who was activated from the practice squad caught a 68 yard td pass from white no waddle no problem receiver missed the first game of his career while in the concussion protocol after a helmet to helmet hit last week waddle has surpassed 1000 receiving yards in each of his first two seasons but without him miamis offense recorded 726 total yards of offense reaction what the dolphins did was noticed around the league i cant wait to watch it quarterback said after a win over atlanta unbelievable i dont know how they did that injuries broncos lb jesey jewell denvers leading tackler left in the first half with a groin injury and did not return dolphins wr injured his

with a game ball afterward you know it feels good to get a win in the league against anybody jets coach robert saleh said but it was a special game for hack obviously being here a year ago we racked up over 400 yards on them put up 31 points hacketts return took on the feel of a grudge match after payton criticized him and his staff for the job they did last year in denver where he went 4 11 and was fired particularly the way he handled wilson during the qbs dismal 2022 season it was good to be honest mostly for coach hackett i wasnt really worried about myself today said breece hall whose long touchdown run on the jets second snap of the second half gave them the lead for good he stayed quiet he stayed humble respectful so we wanted to come in and get a win today for him and we did that better coach better team won the jets 2 3 overcame a sloppy chippy first half to snap a three game skid and hand the broncos 1 4 their third home loss in three tries under payton who drew widespread and also throwing shade at the jets in an interview with usa today in july payton deflected questions about the brouhaha all week and again in his terse postgame news conference its a fair question but i think we already addressed that the next day all right thank you guys payton said just before leaving the podium after the game the in a post on x formerly known as twitter when you lose to the offseason champs  including a photo of comedian kevin james who portrayed payton in a netflix movie although wilson has mostly returned to form under paytons tutelage the broncos are plagued by many of the same problems for which payton blasted hackett and in the second half the boobirds got as loud as they ever did last year the broncos went three and out on four of their first five drives after halftime and the other possession resulted in a lost fumble on the second snap then wilson led the broncos to a touchdown and 2 point conversion to make it 24 21 late in the fourth quarter patrick surtain iis interception of zach wilsons pass to gave the broncos the ball back at their 3 with 214 left big time players gotta make big time plays surtain said adding he felt the broncos had a tremendous amount of momentum going into that drive the broncos were moving toward in field goal range when williams collected his second sack the ball popped loose toward the jets sideline and bryce hall left the receiver he was covering scooped up the bouncing ball and sealed it with his touchdown return a frustrated payton who watched his offense produce a net 18 yard loss on

posting a 104 53 1 mark in seattle hall ran for 177 yards on 22 carries sunday a whopping 8 yards per carry it was nearly a year ago when breece halls promising rookie season ended at this very stadium when he blew out his left knee after scampering for a 62 yard score  making his fourth straight start in place of the injured  was 19 of 26 for 199 yards and the interception he too was happiest for hackett you could see the emotion on his face a little bit wilson said he was trying not to show it but we all gave him big hugs we told him we love him and were grateful to have him obviously how things went for him this past year was tough so you know it means a lot injuries jets rt left with a calf injury in the second half its a concern for sure saleh said when asked if its an

offense is still trying to put everything together it was evident in the way they struggled against denver on third down thursday night the way they kept getting bottled up in short yardage situations and in how they failed time after time to turn red zone trips into touchdowns luckily for us mahomes said our defense is playing great so great that mahomes lone touchdown pass and s four field goals were enough to squeak out a 19 8 victory over the broncos whose own woeful offense could only manage 197 yards behind a shaky performance from  we have guys that are starters on other teams that are trying to find a way on the football field and when they get on the field theyre making plays mahomes said of the kansas city defense and theyre playing with confidence mahomes finished with 306 yards passing and an interception and a big chunk of his production went to  who had nine catches for 124 yards with from an arrowhead stadium suite still the inability of the chiefs 5 1 to score touchdowns rather than field goals nearly proved costly butkers first three field goals helped them to a 16 0 lead but wilsons touchdown pass to  ruled incomplete but overturned upon review  with about six minutes remaining kept the broncos 1 5 alive and when bulled into the end zone for the 2 point conversion what had been a one sided shutout was a one possession game the broncos league worst defense couldnt make a stop though mahomes converted third and 2 with a 28 yard pass to  and that put butker in position for a 52 yard field goal with 155 left that put the game away our defense was incredible tonight as it has been chiefs coach andy reid said but we have to take care of business in the red zone we had a lot of yards positive yards but you cant stall down there the broncos have not beaten the chiefs since sept 17 2015 the year peyton manning led denver to the super bowl that was six head and interim coaches ago and nothing changed with sean payton leading them thursday night in a league built for parity their losing streak is the fourth longest for any team against another in nfl history im disappointed but im not discouraged payton said offensively we struggled throwing the ball our third down numbers were poor the turnovers against a team like this its going to be tough to win the game and yet we were still in it going into the fourth quarter sometimes you dont know how a game is going to unfold as bad as the broncos defense has been this season it was wilson and their offense that kept dragging them down he had 37 yards passing in the first half and the only drive wilson led past midfield ended on fourth down the chiefs werent doing a whole lot better their first three forays into the red zone netted three points thanks to an interception by and a failed tush push out of a field goal lineup on fourth down mahomes who has struggled by his standards all season only found his rhythm once in the first half when he ended a 62 yard drive with a short touchdown pass to  butker made it 13 0 at the break when he drilled a 60 yard field goal as time expired the chiefs red zone woes continued in the second half they began by swiftly marching downfield and setting up first and goal at the denver 8 but that soon turned into fourth and goal at the 7 yard line and butker had to kick another field goal that was all kansas city could muster until his clinching kick in the final minutes thanks to the defense that was all the chiefs needed i thought we did a lot of good things just obviously red zone and some third downs we didnt execute at a high enough level mahomes said i still think there were a lot of good things we can take from it swift in the house swift watched kelce and the chiefs for the third time thursday night the two began a

his 50th nfl game all as a reserve on the play for what would have been a big gain underneath but love was looking to go deep on third and 20 from midfield the broncos 2 5 then ran out the clock with launching a deep heave on fourth and 9 from his own 26 after taking the shotgun snap with 6 seconds remaining and the packers 2 4 out of timeouts that gave payton his first win at home in four tries and snapped the broncos streak of losing 10 consecutive games in which theyd taken a lead into halftime payton wasnt a celebratory mood saying were never happy you know we work hard we want it  im happy we won i am i think i was happier before i came in here to the postgame news conference payton said hes hopeful of much more meaningful milestones and he bristled when asked about denver finally making a halftime lead hold up my team hadnt blown 10 straight payton said so lets start by saying the historically  when the reporter did just that payton cut him off yeah i dont pay attention to that three of those blown halftime leads came on paytons watch and the broncos frittered away a 9 0 advantage at the midpoint sunday before s fourth field goal from 52 yards out with 350 remaining put

within 16 10 in the third quarter on a 16 yard touchdown catch that both he and cornerback patrick surtain ii corralled as they tumbled to the ground on the broadcast cbs rules expert gene steratore said he believed because surtain had two feet down before doubs did therefore steratore argued surtain had completed the catch before doubs had done so that makes me feel better surtain said but at the end of the day it was still a touchdown payton concurred saying i was surprised it wasnt ruled an interception on the field or via the nfls standard review of all scoring plays i think were going to see that was something that should have been called the other way payton said refreee alex kemp however explained to a pool reporter we ruled on the field that the green bay receiver controlled the ball while airborne and came to the ground and never lost control of the ball and therefore by rule it is a touchdown kemp said simultaneous possession wasnt ruled on the field but even if it had been the play still would have resulted in a touchdown nfl senior vice president of officiating walt anderson said the td call was confirmed at league headquarters in new york and since the ruling on the field was a touchdown we reviewed the play for the elements of a catch which were control and maintaining control when he went to the ground and then the receiver kept control of the ball anderson said there were no views that showed that the receiver ever lost control of the ball from the time he initially possessed it until he completed the catch process on the ground lockes interception rendered it a moot point as far as the outcome was concerned wilson rebounded from his worst game as a bronco a week earlier to throw for 195 yards on 20 of 29 passing with one touchdown a 18 yarder

3 5 ended their 16 game losing streak to the chiefs 6 2 by dominating every facet against a team that hadnt lost to denver since week 2 of the 2015 season it was mahomes first loss to denver after 12 wins and his first road defeat in the afc west after winning his first 16 divisional games away from arrowhead stadium he said the broncos had a great game plan and executed and we didnt execute or score any points he said no touchdowns at least mahomes experienced flu like symptoms apparently catching a stomach bug from his wife and two young children who got sick during the week i started feeling bad last night said mahomes who had a pedestrian day with a 592 passer rating three sacks and two interceptions in beating kansas city for the first time in 2965 days the broncos outplayed the chiefs in every phase afterward they were serenaded off the field to the sound of taylor swifts shake it off blaring throughout empower field swift wasnt on hand to witness or the awful day for the rest of the chiefs who posted three field goals went 0 for 3 in the red zone and turned it over four times on offense to go with a turnover on downs and a muffed punt that denver recovered simmons recovered a fumble and picked off mahomes for the sixth time in his career those takeaways led to 10 points as the broncos posted back to back wins for the first time in over a year only threw 19 times but three of his dozen completions were in the end zone to receivers a and a and running back a who ran 27 times for 85 yards and caught three passes for 13 yards williams td was his first since returning from a devastating left knee injury he suffered in the first month of the 2022 season we believe in who we are wilson said after the broncos who came in averaging just 22 carries a game next to last in the league ran the ball 40 times for 153 yards in controlling the clock and the tempo denver made a 14 9 halftime lead hold up by controlling the clock and keeping mahomes and kelce cooling their cleats on the sideline in the second half kansas city had just three second half possessions before getting the ball back for one meaningless snap at the end the broncos blew the game open when rookie linebacker recovered mecole hardmans muffed punt at the chiefs 10 yard line early in the fourth quarter two plays later wilson hit sutton in the left corner to make it 21 9 making the broncos the first opponent to top 20 points against kc this season mahomes drove the chiefs to the denver 27 but couldnt bring in a perfectly placed toss in the end zone on fourth down with 735 left simmons who had a fumble recovery in the first half intercepted mahomes with about 5 minutes left and the broncos added a short field goal with 31 seconds remaining the chiefs never trailed by more than 10 points in any of their 16 consecutive wins over denver  it was the third longest win streak against one opponent in nfl history  but they fell behind 14 3 early on and never found their footing in the first half mahomes also was intercepted by cornerback and strip sacked by with recovering the loose ball patrick mahomes is a hard quarterback to sack said browning who had three qb hits to go with his two sacks he scrambles he can move around stop on a dime spin around there was a play early in the game where i thought i had a kill shot he stopped hes a playmaker so it feels good to be able to corral him like a chicken red zone red faced three weeks ago at arrowhead the chiefs were just 1 for 5 in the red zone but managed to pull off a 19 8 win against the broncos on sunday they were 0 for 3 inside denvers 20 yeah we werent down there too much today said mahomes who was held without a touchdown throw for the first time since dec 5 2021 in a 22 9 win over denver its the worst i felt walking out of the stadium mahomes said after losing for the first time in six trips to denver its a great environment and i actually have a lot of fun playing here they love the game they know the

the  smothering defense never lost faith in his sputtering offense whose first nine drives ended with kicking five field goals and punting four times we just believe in each other  we knew we were going to win this game wilson said after driving denver on its only touchdown drive in the closing minutes for a 21 20 victory over the minnesota vikings on sunday night ending the nfls longest winning streak at five games s with 103 remaining was the difference for denver 5 5 which now owns the leagues longest winning streak at four this guys been lights out wilson said of sutton who outleapt cornerback for his eighth td of the season hes one of the best in the game and i tried to put it on a place that only he could get it and sure enough wilson was smacked just as he released the throw and never saw the game winning reception i think my head was turned sideways i just heard the crowd going crazy and knew he caught it s tackle of on the 2 point try kept the vikings within a point and needing a field goal by in denvers thin air to win it the broncos defense  which produced three more takeaways giving denver a dozen over its last three games  didnt allow the vikings 6 5 to get out of their own side of the field on minnesotas desperation drive in the final minute however denver forced into an intentional grounding that brought up fourth and 25 before dobbs threw one final incompletion from the vikings 21 with 16 seconds left dobbs threw for 221 yards and a touchdown and ran for another but lost with the vikings for the first time since they acquired him in an emergency trade with arizona still he became the first quarterback in nfl history to have both a touchdown throw and a touchdown run in his first three games with a team man hes a lot slippier than i ever realized  he was tough to get down broncos coach sean payton said and hes taller i turned to offensive coordinator joe lombardi in pregame and said gosh i dont remember dobbs being 6 3 and i didnt realize how well he can move in the pocket and we all kind of lived it in that last 2 minute drive it was just one escape after the other and finally we got off the field wilson went 27 of 35 for 259 yards without an interception for denver the broncos started their go ahead drive from their 25 with 317 remaining after josephs field goal made it 20 15 that kick capped a 7 minute 20 second drive by the vikings that featured a fake punt from their own 30 took the snap on fourth and 5 and scurried 31 yards into denver territory he added a 19 yard catch and run before the drive stalled at the broncos 12 that 20 15 lead seemed safe given that denver had struggled to find any rhythm all night finishing 2 for 12 on third down and watching the vikings outrun them 175 yards to 46 yards for a 10 minute advantage in time of possession wilson drove the broncos 75 yards in 10 plays to give denver which trailed 17 9 after three quarters its first lead since 3 0 its hard in this league to go on the road and win and its even harder when you dont take care of the football like youre supposed to dobbs said the broncos kept stalling deep in minnesota territory with lutz connecting from 31 31 53 37 and 28 yards that last one came after nickelback s interception of dobbs set up the broncos offense just inside the vikings 10 yard line jackson back in action broncos safety returned from a two game suspension for an illegal hit and on the vikings opening drive he led with the crown of his helmet on a third and 1 run by dobbs jarring the ball loose no flag was thrown and mcmillian jumped on the loose ball at the vikings 30 yard line denvers second straight opening drive takeaway dobbs went straight to the medical tent but came right back out and didnt miss any snaps it seemed like a pretty direct helmet to helmet type hit vikings coach kevin oconnnell said the rule is what it is they didnt throw the flag it happened fast out there well have to take a look at it so too will the nfl which has already fined jackson 89670 for four illegal hits before suspending him two games costing jackson 279000 in lost wages jacksons hit should have resulted in a 15 yard penalty with minnesota maintaining possession suggested nbc rules analyst terry mcaulay he lowers his head and makes forcible contact to the opponent mcaulay said on the broadcast you see his head is down this should have been a 15 yard penalty for unnecessary roughness injuries vikings dl suffered a pectoral injury in the first half and was ruled out for the remainder of the game wr missed his sixth game

leading lions 10 4 could clinch a spot in the postseason for the first time since the 2016 season if other results go their way the rest of week 15 the simplest scenario would be a loss or tie by seattle to philadelphia on monday night if detroit wins a division title for the first time since 1993 it would host a playoff game the lions have only one playoff victory since the franchise won the nfl title in 1957 it would be fun but weve got work to do goff said the broncos hopes of making the playoffs for the first time since the 2015 season took a hit denver 7 7 had won six of its previous seven games to pull within a game of afc west leading kansas city weve got to keep believing quarterback said weve done it before goff and the the lions had lost two of three but they put that behind them with a dominant second quarter weve been through a lot of adversity as a group and a three game lull is not the worst thing weve been through goff said the veteran quarterback who turned the ball over eight times in the previous four games threw touchdown passes in the second quarter to laporta rookie running back and amon ra st brown to give detroit a 21 0 halftime lead denver meanwhile was 1 of 6 on third down and had just 75 yards in the first half it was the ultimate team win the defense started it out for us coach dan campbell said the broncos had a touchdown on fourth down negated late in the third when offensive lineman was flagged for being offside broncos coach sean payton proceeded to on the sideline and denver settled for a field goal to cut its deficit to 28 10 i was

fumble on his first possession finished 18 of 32 for 223 yards with a touchdown pass and a rushing td he was relieved by backup on a meaningless final series goff was 24 of 34 for 278 yards throwing five touchdown passes for the first time since 2018 when he played for the rams and didnt have a turnover he joined houstons as the only qbs to throw for five tds in a game this season the broncos had given up just four touchdown passes over the previous six games laporta a second round pick from iowa became the first rookie tight end to have at least 70 receptions 700 yards and nine touchdowns st brown had seven catches for 112 yards and a score after totaling five receptions in the previous two games the lions leaned on a strong running game with gibbs and combining for 185 yards and 27

that includes a 4 0 record in las vegas after both teams ended their season at 8 9 and out of the playoffs the focus in las vegas turns to whether owner mark davis elevates pierce or hires someone outside the organization the raiders went 5 4 since pierce  why wouldnt we keep going the direction were going raiders defensive end said the fact weve come together and done something special in such a short time is hard to do weve got a guy whos played at the highest level won a super bowl hes been a captain and now hes a great coach and hes a leader las vegas locker room was one big party with cigar smoke hanging in the air and former raiders stars  ted hendricks jim otto jim plunkett and charles woodson taking it all in pierce also made it a point to enjoy the moment while also hoping this ride continues into next season i was having fun as the linebacker coach pierce said that was cool right but it is really cool being the head coach of the  its really cool being in front of a room with men who buy in and believe what youre telling what youre saying how to do things i love football man i said before its my first love football never cheated on me it doesnt talk back to me its always there as for the game itself las vegas took full control on the first play of the fourth quarter oconnell overcame a injury to the index finger on his throwing hand  he didnt play the raiders

11 times he quarterbacked the raiders over their final two games last season in place of  who also was benched i thought we lost in a lot of areas tonight denver coach sean payton said i felt like they ran it better than us they protected better than us our quarterback was under a lot more duress than theirs you can point to a number of things the broncos will have plenty of time to address those points as their offseason begins same with the raiders beginning with what they do regarding the coaching job the players have made it known since midseason they want pierce to get the job now

his knee in the final full practice before game day it wasnt feeling right chiefs coach andy reid said i wasnt going to put him out there with that and he was honest with me detroit scored first in a showdown of two of the leagues top offenses a year ago goff took advantage of a clean pocket thanks in part to jones sitting in a stadium suite to march down field and find st brown with a 9 yard touchdown pass the chiefs answered with mahomes finding five different wide receivers on a long drive the last of them rookie  who atoned for an earlier drop by snaring a short touchdown pass to knot the game at 7 apiece it remained that way until campbell made a questionable decision late in the half the chiefs were facing fourth and 2 near midfield but had been called for holding and rather than decline it campbell chose to push them back mahomes responded to third and 17 by hitting with a 24 yard strike he added a 26 yard pass to  then hit with a short td throw to give the chiefs a 14 7 halftime lead with the lions offense still going nowhere in the second half the defense stepped up branch caught a pass that bounced off toneys hands and found nothing but 50 yards of grass separating him from the end zone and a 14 all tie up to that point mahomes had thrown 20 touchdown passes without an interception in five plus season openers the chiefs tacked on two field goals but the missed chances to get into the end zone proved costly the lions followed up harrison butkers second kick by driving 75 yards twice converting on third down with montgomery capping the march with a 9 yard touchdown run that gave detroit the the lead for good the lions did a heck of a job they capitalized on a couple of things and weve got to fix it reid said i liked the aggressiveness on the defensive side there were some good things on offense we just have to be more consistent streak ends the lions marvin jones fumbled away a good scoring chance in the second quarter when knocked the ball out deep in kansas city territory it was the veteran wide receivers first fumble in his 12 year career and came on his 563rd touch the longest active streak in the nfl latest on kelce and some swelling in his knee though tests taken after the injury in practice showed no ligament damage he went through a workout early thursday to see whether he could move well enough to play but reid and chiefs trainer rick burkholder decided to give kelce time to recover with their next game 10 days away injuries lions branch the first player with a pick 6 in his lions debut since 1967 departed with cramps on the

tell my son that i beat the packers so im excited to say that and excited to be a part of this team montgomery carried the ball 32 times after sitting out the a on sunday with a thigh bruise he became the first lion to rush for three touchdowns at green bay and the first detroit player to top 100 yards rushing with three tds since james stewart in 2000 he was balling lions receiver amon ra st brown said we can count on him whenever give him the ball hes going to make something happen the lions 3 1 beat the packers 2 2 for a fourth straight time a streak that also includes the when detroit denied green bay a playoff spot in  last game with the packers detroit has built on the momentum from that season ending victory by getting off to a fast start this year that now includes road victories over the packers and the a send us anywhere line us up against anyone and we feel like we can go in there and beat them said lions quarterback  who went 19 of 28 for 210 yards with a touchdown and an

two passes intercepted by  detroit led 27 3 at halftime and had outgained green bay 284 yards to 21 as the half ended with boos from the crowd it was the lions highest scoring first half against the packers in the series 188 game history the packers earlier in the week trailing new orleans 17 0 on sunday before scoring 18 points in the final 11 minutes for a one point victory green bay faced a halftime deficit of at least 17 points in back to back weeks for the first time in franchise history this time it was too much to overcome i think just offensively as a whole weve just got to start faster love said we dont start fast and we kind of get behind and its hard running the ball we get put in situations where youve got to throw the ball so i think weve just got to start faster love got the packers within 10 points his 1 yard touchdown pass to capped a season long 86 yard drive to open the second half ended the third quarter with a 44 yard catch that set up loves 9 yard touchdown run with 1452 left in the game to make it 27 17 detroit responded with a 14 play 75 yard drive capped by on fourth and goal that took nearly nine minutes off the clock and put the game away the lions were prepared to settle for a 30 yard field goal that would have kept it as a two score game but they got a first down when green bays received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for running forward and leaping across the line in an attempt to block the kick i was just in the moment but ive got to be aware walker said thats on me considering the way the game started it was surprising it was still competitive in the fourth quarter intercepted goff on the third play from scrimmage to set up a field goal detroit then scored 24 points on its next four drives to delight the who decorated the lambeau field stands in honolulu blue goffs 24 yard touchdown pass to a wide open st brown put the lions ahead for good montgomery scored on runs of 3 and 2 yards while kicked field goals of 33 and 37

kneeled down three times kicked a 41 yard field goala as time expired and the lions prevailed in a 41 38 shootout over the chargers goff appreciates playing for a coach whos willing to make such gutsy calls im sure in his head he didnt want to give justin the ball back with a minute and a half said goff who threw for 333 yards and two touchdowns its a lot of fun when he puts the ball in our hands to make a play in a matchup between two of the leagues most aggressive coaches campbell and the lions were 4 of 5 on fourth down conversions while the chargers converted all three one of those things we havent done a lot of is win the close shootouts every time you win and get it done you learn something from it campbell said the offense really showed up today big time the chargers 4 5 tied it at

progress and he kind of optioned away from k9 linebacker  staley said los angeles scored touchdowns on its final five drives but even that wasnt enough i thought early on it was gonna be a shootout

big games where we put up some points it didnt happen today said herbert who completed 27 of 40 passes for 323 yards with the four touchdowns and an interception a pair of 1 yard td runs by gibbs put the lions up 17 3 midway through the second quarter his first score was set up by a 35 yard scamper where he went off right end and then made a nice cut before being tackled just short of the end zone the chargers got within 24 17 on s 2 yard carry with 23 seconds remaining in the first half after forcing detroit to punt on the opening series of the second half los angeles tied it when herbert

over dallas on jan 5 1992 they lost a home playoff game two years later and hadnt hosted one since it means a whole lot to this city goff said we knew what it meant when this season started to get into the playoffs and then to get this win and you know its just the beginning for us weve got some run left detroit the nfcs no 3 seed will have two home playoff games for the first time in franchise history hosting either tampa bay or philadelphia in the divisional round next sunday second seeded dallas was routed by green bay the rams 10 8 had a chance to take the lead late in the fourth quarter but detroits defense denied them a holding penalty pushed los angeles out of field goal range and stafford  the lions longtime quarterback who won a super bowl after he was traded to the rams  threw incomplete on fourth down on the first play after the two minute warning goff hit amon ra st brown for 11 yards allowing the lions to run out the clock  much to the delight of long suffering fans who witnessed the franchises second postseason victory since winning the 1957 nfl title thats the best home atmosphere ive ever played in and i expect next week will top that goff said against the franchise he once led to the super bowl goff was 22 of 27 for 277 yards and threw a 2 yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end that put detroit ahead 21 10 midway through the second quarter the lions acquired goff and a pair of first round picks for stafford three years ago jared was really efficient you could see the command that he has said rams coach sean mcvay whose relationship with goff soured before the trade theres a lot made of it but im really happy for him we wanted to come away with a win but hes done a great job stafford who played most of the game with a bandaged and bloody hand after he slammed it into a defenders helmet finished 25 of 36 for 367 yards with two touchdowns i wouldnt want anyone else as our quarterback other than matthew stafford mcvay said he was outstanding he was gritty he was gutsy and made tough throw after tough throw the rush was barreling down on him and he stood in there and was dropping dimes all day detroit drafted stafford no 1 overall in 2009 and while he put up gaudy statistics he didnt win a playoff game in his 12 seasons stafford hugged dozens of detroits players and staff members after the game im happy for the players he said im happy for those guys record breaking rookie had nine receptions for 181 yards and a touchdown for the rams and rookie each had a rushing td for the lions and st brown had seven receptions for 110 yards after trailing by 11 points the rams got within 21 17 at halftime thanks to staffords 50 yard touchdown pass to nacua and his 38 yarder to  michael badgleys season long 54 yard field goal  the longest of his postseason career and tied for the longest in detroits playoff history  gave the lions a seven point lead midway through the third quarter the rams moved the ball at will for much of the game but had to settle for short field goals by to get within 24 23 with 810 remaining the difference in the game was the red area mcvay said stafford has made a career of fourth quarter comebacks a fact the fans at ford field were well aware of with a chance to put the rams ahead for the first time he led a drive to the detroit 34 but the lions defense forced him backwards from there detroit took over with 407 to go and los angeles had only one timeout left after calling two earlier in the half to cope with the crowd noise that allowed goff to take a knee after his throw to st

span of the third quarter to tie the nfc championship game and then pulled away in the fourth quarter to earn a rematch against kansas city after losing to the chiefs in the super bowl four years ago no one was rah rah purdy said no one was freaking out its football theres a lot of experienced guys on this team veteran guys who have been in crazy situations we were just like we have to do our job san francisco mounted the fourth comeback ever from 17 points down or more in a conference title game thanks to some and bad mistakes from the lions 14 6 including two failed fourth downs in field goal range detroit fell short of reaching the first super bowl in franchise history were not going out like this coach kyle shanahan said of the mindset at halftime guys didnt want today to be the last day we put ourselves in a hole they played like it in the second half and we were able to get the ball to bounce the right way and we made up for what we did in the first half after being questioned about whether he could lead a comeback purdy has now done it twice in as many weeks he engineered a game winning drive in the fourth quarter to beat green bay last week and then had an even bigger comeback against the lions he finished with 267 yards passing and a touchdown along with 48 yards rushing thanks to a pair of 21 yard scrambles now the last pick of the 2022 draft will be

today it was hard at the beginning but the character we have in our team the type of guys we have we cant wait to get to vegas man the niners blew a 10 point lead in the fourth quarter of the nfc championship game against the two years ago and then were forced to play much of last years title game loss at philadelphia without a functioning quarterback after purdy injured his elbow on the opening drive and fourth stringer left with a concussion early in the third quarter but san francisco managed to make the long journey back to this stage and now is in position to deliver the franchise its record tying sixth super bowl title and first since the 1994 season a magical season for the lions ended in heartbreak detroit remains the only team to play every season of the super bowl era without reaching the ultimate game this looked like it could be the year to end that drought when detroit won back to back playoff games after winning just one in the previous 56 seasons but the lions couldnt finish the job despite holding a 24 7 halftime lead when you lose that way its hard coach dan campbell said you feel like you get your heart ripped out but im proud of that group and

fourth and 2 from the san francisco 28 but couldnt hold onto a pass from  leading to a turnover on downs the lions then seemed to have a potential interception when purdys deep pass bit in the face mask but the ball popped up and was caught for a spectacular 51 yard gain by aiyuk when i saw him catch that i was like thats insane purdy said purdy found aiyuk three plays later for a 6 yard score before the game a ladybug landed on my shoe and you all know what that means aiyuk said thats all i can say other than that i dont know then fumbled on the next play from scrimmage setting up a 1 yard run by mccaffrey to tie the game at 24 it only got worse from there for the lions with reynolds dropping another pass on third down leading to a punt that detroit had a chance to down at the 1 but botched purdy then drove the niners to a 33 yard field goal by and their first lead of the game momentum certainly changed pretty quickly goff said they scored we didnt convert the fourth down they scored again we turned the ball over that little sequence right there makes it tough campbell bypassed a chance at a game tying field goal on fourth and 3 from the niners 30 midway through the fourth quarter goff threw an incomplete pass and the niners drove to the insurance touchdown goff added a td pass to with 56 seconds to play but the 49ers recovered the onside kick to seal the win goff finished 25 for 41 for 273 yards and a touchdown san franciscos heralded front seven had no answer in the first half for detroits offensive line which repeatedly opened up big holes giving the backs several yards even before first contact the lions ran for 148 yards in the first half getting td runs from williams and gibbs added a late field goal to give detroit a 24 7 lead at the half tied for

fearing an achilles tendon injury but said cousins was still undergoing evaluation the severity of that i do not know at this point but i do know thats what our fear is at the moment oconnell said cousins has never missed a game because of injury in his 12 year career he did sit out a during the 2021 season because of a positive covid 19 test he walked gingerly to the sideline after getting sacked on consecutive plays midway early in the fourth quarter though it appeared the injury happened before anyone made contact with him just some of my dialogue with kirk it seems like maybe his cleat might have gotten stuck in the ground or whatever it was oconnell said its not probably right for me to speculate i just know that it was incredibly incredibly unfortunate in that moment cousins injury leaves the vikings with limited quarterback options  a rookie fifth round pick from byu for the rest of the game the vikings also have  who has made 17 starts but is currently on injured reserve with a back injury this marked the first packers vikings matchup since 2006 in which both teams entered the game with losing records though minnesota got back to 500 on sunday with its third consecutive victory the vikings recent surge offered reason to believe the defending nfc north champions could contend for a playoff spot but cousins injury puts those hopes in jeopardy theres nothing really i can say about it tight end said i just love kirk to death i love his family i love him i love everything about him and to see a guy like that go down is always tough hockenson and had touchdown receptions less than two minutes apart early in the third quarter put minnesota ahead for good in the opening period by giving the vikings their first touchdown run of the season cousins went 23 of 31 for 274 yards he has thrown five touchdown passes with one interception during minnesotas winning streak went out today again as he has for most of the 2023 season and played the quarterback position as well as anybody in our league and just continued to build and build and build oconnell said the packers 2 5 lost their fourth straight and continued their penchant for  the packers have been outscored 73 9 in the first half of their past five games and havent scored a touchdown before halftime in any of them well that was obviously tough to watch packers coach matt lafleur said  just way too many mistakes minnesota dominated the first two quarters but only led 10 3 at the break largely because of missed opportunities but the vikings wasted no time breaking the game open early in the third quarter cousins 2 yard touchdown pass to hockenson capped a 13 play 75 yard drive to begin the second half on the packers ensuing possession threw deep to  but made a with his back to the quarterback and then delivered a 43 yard interception return to give the vikings the ball at the green bay 20 on the next play cousins found addison in the end zone to extend minnesotas lead to 24 3 green bay finally reached the end zone on loves 1 yard pass to on fourth and goal late in the third quarter to cut the lead to 24 10 but the packers couldnt get any closer the packers lost the ball on downs on each of their last three drives including two that reached the red zone love was 24 of 41 for 229 yards with one touchdown and an interception its frustrating man love said im frustrated everybody in that locker rooms frustrated plain and simple were not winning were losing games and its all games that we should be winning i think that were right there

to set up a fourth quarter field goal johnson said he didnt know hed be starting until sunday but visualized that he would get his first career interception i saw the quarterbacks eyes and saw where he was going so i broke that way johnson said and as im running that way i see the corner route is coming and im going to close and ja flies out of the air tips it up im like oh there it is its mine

mishandled a snap and then tried to roll to his right sacked him and forced a fumble that devondre campbell recovered at the rams 41 yard line the packers fumbled the ball away on each of their first two second half series but the rams failed to capitalize either time after recovered  fumble at the rams 42 los angeles punted rather than attempting a long field goal on fourth and 17 from the 36 knocked the ball from aaron jones on the packers next series and duke shelleys 9 yard fumble return gave the rams the ball on the green bay 36 the rams ensuing possession ended with havrisiks 49 yard

going to somehow find a way even when the steelers are outgained  which is always at least in 2023 even when theyre out played  which is frequently even when the only place they regularly look like a team in playoff contention is the standings  which is essentially the story of the first half of a season that is somehow both chaotic and utterly predictable at the same time maybe thats why harris more or less shrugged after a 23 19 win over green bay on sunday that had all the hallmarks of so many victories that have come before a little offense a couple of timely turnovers and just enough of everything else to survive im just so used to close games i dont even realize it harris said after running for 82 yards and a touchdown thats just how we are seemingly every single week the steelers 6 3 have ripped off nine straight wins in one score games dating to last season all six of their wins so far in 2023 have come by eight points or less a trend that defies the logic of the every game is a coin flip nfl the odds figure to even out at some point theyre just not in pittsburgh not yet anyway it just shows in those pressure moments we come up making the big plays outside linebacker said the patched together steelers secondary provided two of them late veteran cornerback tipped s pass a in the end zone with 320 to go to end one threat safety later stepped in front of loves last second heave at the goal line on the final play as the steelers head into a pivotal two game road trip to afc north rivals cleveland and cincinnati with momentum  introduced as a co starter with harris for the first time ran for a career high 101 yards and a touchdown on a day the two running backs combined for 206 of pittsburghs 324 total yards kicked three field goals  including two in the 16 minutes after green bay took a slim 19 17 lead  to help the steelers improve to 3 1 since their bye week all that matters is we keep winning games center said we dont care how we get them as long as we get them love completed 21 of 40 for 289 yards and two touchdowns for green bay but the packers 3 6 were unable to back up last weeks victory over the despite outgaining the steelers by 75 yards then again that doesnt mean much when playing pittsburgh the steelers have been outgained in every game this season and it somehow hasnt stopped them from staying in the thick of the playoff race as thanksgiving approaches green bay meanwhile has dropped 5 of 6 since a 2 1 start you see how close we are a play here or a play there packers running back said i feel like we just keep pushing at it if we keep putting in the work itll go in our favor if green bay wants to find a team to emulate it could do worse than pittsburgh the steelers dont win games so much as they dont beat themselves wearing the vintage block numbers from the franchises iconic 1970s teams pittsburgh didnt turn the ball over for the third time in four games and let the team on the other side of the field make the costly mistakes when it mattered it may not always look pretty the steelers are aware of this they also dont particularly care theyre winning games while not always playing winning football yet theyre also not playing losing football it may not be sustainable long term but for now its working we should just be better in certain ways so that you dont have to have such a heart attack at the end of the game highsmith said but whenever were in those got to have it moments were capitalizing praise canada the steelers scored on each of their first three drives while taking a 17 7 lead at times the offense looked as fluid as it has in a long time in the second game since embattled offensive coordinator matt canada moved from the coachs box to the sideline in an effort find what head coach mike tomlin has called a new perspective dont expect canada to move anytime soon harris said canada surprised him by giving him a hug after harris and spent time in between series going to each position group to discuss what was and wasnt working injuries steelers lb exited in the first quarter with what tomlin called a serious leg injury and did not return alexander is the second pittsburgh inside

continually had come up just short late in games this season thats always in the back of my head just the past experiences that weve had being in this situation and not capitalizing love said our message was just go finish go compete and go be great i think we did that love went 27 of 40 and became the first packer to throw for more than 300 yards since had a 341 yard day against the on dec 12 2021 i wasnt aware of that love said thats a pretty crazy stat to be honest both teams have struggled in close games four of the packers six losses have been decided by a total of 11 points five of the chargers six defeats have a combined margin of 14 points its tough bro chargers safety derwin james said like i said were playing hard its tough were one or two plays away i say youve got to find a way to get it done chargers coach brandon staley bristled when asked again after the game whether hes considered giving up the defensive play calling responsibilities i have full confidence in our way of playing staley said full confidence in myself as the play caller and the way that we teach and the way that we scheme full confidence in that weve got to bring this group together and do it consistently and thats where its at you can stop asking that question im going to be calling the defenses so were clear so you dont have to ask that again both teams suffered significant injuries chargers edge rusher was carted off the field with a foot injury on the games opening series packers running backs and were carted off the field late in the second quarter leaving as green bays only ball carrier staley had no update on bosas condition after the game jones said initial reports regarding his anterior cruciate ligament were positive though he was awaiting an mri i was feeling like

35 yard gain doubs made his touchdown catch two plays after that snaring the ball as cornerback tried to break up the pass loves other touchdown pass was an 11 yarder to with 4 seconds left in the

less than 1 12 minutes left batted down a pass by herbert on fourth and 1 from the los angeles 35 to put the game away one play earlier had his arms outstretched but couldnt hang onto a pass around

the  who beat the visiting  just like we talked about that playoff mentality to come in here with one job in mind and find a way to win mayfield said we did that this was the third straight season in which mayfield faced the packers at lambeau field in december  each time for a different team he threw four interceptions in clevelands to the packers in 2021 and was los angeles starter when the last dec 19 mayfield was sacked five times sunday just as he was in those other lambeau field appearances but he otherwise was far more successful going 22 of 28 and posting a perfect passer rating of 1583 the third times a charm thats for sure said mayfield who grew up rooting for former packers quarterback brett favre mayfield threw touchdown passes of 19 yards to  26 yards to  2 yards to and 52 yards

whooped us in every phase  outcoached us outplayed us packers coach matt lafleur said its disappointing mayfield picked apart green bays defense one week after the packers lost 24 22 to the new york giants by allowing a late drive that resulted in s game winning field goal as time expired lafleur was asked after sundays loss whether hed consider replacing defensive coordinator joe barry during the season nows not the time for that to be honest with you lafleur said lafleur later added im trying to find solutions ive got to go back and take a look at the film after going 14 of 29 each of the last two weeks mayfield opened the game with seven straight completions and later threw touchdown passes on tampa bays first three second half possessions the bucs concluded their fourth and final second half drive by taking a knee at the green bay 11 yard line mayfield lost a fumble at his own 4 line to set up a first quarter touchdown for green bay but that was pretty much the only mistake he made a week earlier mayfield threw an 11 yard touchdown pass to with 31 seconds left in a at atlanta hes meant everything from a mental standpoint to a quarterback standpoint making plays from a toughness standpoint from a leadership standpoint bucs coach todd bowles said hes done everything hes checked all the boxes hes doing all the right things now i cant say enough about him mayfield drove the bucs into position for s 46 yard field goal just before halftime that put tampa bay ahead at the break after tampa bay forced a three and out on the opening drive of the second half the bucs extended their lead to 20 10 on mayfields touchdown pass to white green bay answered on its next series as love scrambled and found reed in the right corner of the end zone for a 17 yard gain on third and 15 tampa bay answered as kieft scored on his first catch of the season after the packers cut the lead to 27 20 on anders carlsons 33 yard field goal with 1004 left mayfield threw a short pass that moore turned into a 52 yard touchdown it was moores first td since 2020 when he played for seattle moores touchdown came on third and 4 tampa bay was 7 of 11 on third down conversions and 1 of 1 on

well at all but still had a chance at the end to go out there and execute is a sign of a high character team after spending all regular season as front runners the niners 13 5 rallied behind purdy and mccaffrey to reach their third straight nfc championship game and they will host it this time after losing the past two on the road san francisco will play the winner of sundays game between tampa bay and detroit next weekend for a spot in the super bowl purdy went 6 for 7 for 47 yards on the decisive drive converting a third down with a 10 yard pass to and throwing a 17 yarder to  obviously its four quarters for a reason you know so the way i started its like man ive got to be better got to play efficient football purdy said but when it comes down to it with the season on the line youve got to make it happen for your boys around you mccaffrey finished it off with his 6 yard run on third and short and the 49ers defense held on from there with intercepting for the second time to seal san franciscos fifth straight playoff win over green bay 10 9 we feel exhausted linebacker said that took everything it took everyone we knew itd be a close game thats a heck of a team they give us everything this is the playoffs we knew we had to find a way to win no matter what that last throw across his body was one of the few mistakes by love who had given the packers the lead with two td passes in the third quarter but his first full season as the starter in place of had a disappointing ending its tough love said very tough we had an opportunity to win that game and didnt capitalize on it its a tough way to end the season purdy  who struggled with his accuracy early on a rainy night  threw for 252 yards and a touchdown and mccaffrey rushed for 98 yards on 17 carries love put the niners in the unusual spot of playing from behind green bay converted a third and 15 when was called for a 41 yard pass interference penalty against  love and melton connected on the next play for a wide open 19 yard touchdown aided by tashaun gipson slipping on the wet grass in coverage after mccaffrey put san francisco back in the lead with a 39 yard td run green bay struck quickly thanks to a 73 yard kick return by all pro that he fumbled only to have teammate recover four plays later love threw a 2 yard touchdown pass to tyler kraft and the packers extended the lead to 21 14 on a 2 point conversion pass to  it was the story of our whole team 49ers coach kyle shanahan said there was times when we were all off the niners were the first team to make the playoffs in 13 seasons without overcoming a second half deficit to win a game they got a 52 yard field goal from on the first play of the fourth quarter to make it a four point game and it stayed there when rookie missed a 41 yarder for green bay the packers moved the ball easily in the first half getting into the red zone on three straight drives to open the game but they couldnt finishing any of them off setting for two field goals and getting stopped on a fourth and 1 sneak they became the first team in 20 years to reach the red zone on their first three drives of a playoff game without getting a td the niners made them pay for that with purdy hitting on a 32 yard pass on the run for a td that gave san francisco the lead but san francisco squandered another chance late in the half when shanahan wasted time before settling for a 48 yard field goal attempt by moody that was blocked by to send the niners into the half with a 7 6 lead jones finished with 108 yards on 18 carries for the packers and love was 21 of 34 for 194 yards for the packers who overcame a 2 5 start to the season to make it this far for us to lose this game certainly stings and im sure its going to sting for a long time coach matt lafleur said but i was proud of the effort of our guys our ability to weather some real adversity throughout the course of the season and stick together injuries packers rt left in the third quarter

the dolphins an early lead in a 28 3 win saturday tagovailoa sat down after that ending his day 5 of 7 for 61 yards for the dolphins 1 1 it was just a bad play tagovailoa said thats really all it was bad quarterback play there thats not how you want to start a drive anyway you look at it bad play but im glad with the way we responded miami coach mike mcdaniel was glad tagovailoa was able to knock some of the rust off before the season opener sept 10 against the chargers that is exactly what preseason is for he said that is why you want someone to play im glad he got it out of the way but more importantly the team didnt blink tagovailoa said he wasnt concerned about taking hits after having two concussions last season its a physical sport its tough he said i went out there and was expecting to get hit i was expecting to go to the ground all of that houston rookie was much sharper saturday than he was in his nfl debut last week when he was picked off on his first possession and finished with 13 yards passing on two drives playing the entire first half saturday the second overall pick was 7 of 12 for 60 yards and helped the texans 1 1 to a field goal on his second drive i feel like i took a step stroud said definitely got to clean up some things but i feel like overall i got in a good rhythm and i started playing football like im used to he had five straight completions on that

that hell replace this season coach demeco ryans discussed the ways stroud improved from his previous game i think overall just with the operation of the offense he said i thought that cj was more efficient and more comfortable and i think that everyone around him played better and that allowed him to play better so im proud of the progression that cj took this week while stroud showed improvement saturday perhaps the biggest play of the day for houston came early in the second quarter by defensive end  who was taken third in this years draft anderson came off the line unblocked and to sack a for an 11 yard loss and force a fumble thompson quickly jumped on the ball to get it back i thought will did a really good job of disrupting by playing on their side of the line of scrimmage ryans said thats what we want from our defensive linemen anderson who had 58 12 tackles for losses and 34 12 sacks in three seasons for alabama is expected to help improve a defense that has struggled to get to the quarterback in recent years so what does anderson think when the only person between him and the quarterback is a running back they called the play they knew what was going to happen anderson said with a laugh im just going out there and doing my job that drive ended in a punt for miami but thompson got going after that throwing two touchdown passes in the second quarter to make it 21 3 at the half ahmed scored the first one on an 8 yard reception before thompson connected with on an 18 yard score that touchdown was set up by a three plays earlier tagovailoa by  who returned it 19 yards the texans couldnt capitalize on the turnover as stroud was called for a delay of game on third down from the 1 and his pass on fourth down fell incomplete thompsons third touchdown pass came on an 18 yard throw to undrafted free agent rookie that made it 28 3 late in the third quarter thompson threw for 157 yards injuries dolphins rookie devon achane was carted off the field in the

penetrating front like houston has you have to be on your ps and qs a lot of people have to execute things and then people have to make plays when the opportunity is there ryans said the team has to

i worked for and definitely earned nothing else really changes im still going to work they way i have been working  even more now added stroud the second overall pick out of ohio state in the 2023 nfl draft so blessed enough to be a starter so young in this league which isnt the easiest thing to do but i know my coaches have trust and faith in me while stroud provided a glimpse of his potential the 36 year old graham offered evidence that he can still make the type of plays saints fans remember from his first five nfl seasons in new orleans from 2010 to 2014 the five time pro bowl tight end who signed with the saints last month after spending the previous season out of football caught three passes for 34 yards and a touchdown it was nice to see jimmy had a couple of nice catches  contested catches saints coach dennis allen said weve said this that we dont have to see it every day from these guys particularly the veteran players yet at some point we have to see it  and we saw it tonight his catches were reminiscent of the way he played when drew brees was his quarterback he established leverage with his 6 foot 7 frame in tight coverage and came down with contested catches his score on a 3 yard pass from came shortly after his 25 yard grab had given new orleans a first down on the houston 11 jimmy has been jimmy since he first walked in the building winston said i just think that a lot of other tight ends have had opportunities this preseason after his touchdown  which delighted a superdome crowd longing to see the ever popular graham score for the saints again the former miami basketball player leapt up toward the goal post as if to dunk the ball over the cross bar he aborted however and avoided a flag by instead firing the ball off the padded wall behind the end zone dunking the ball over the cross bar became a rule violation in 2014 in part because grahams former trademark td celebration forced a delay during a 2013 thursday night game when he knocked a goal post out of alignment graham sat out new orleans second preseason against the chargers in los angeles last weekend that game was played two days after graham was arrested by newport beach police during what the saints have described as a likely seizure that caused the 2013 all pro to become disoriented graham was charged with suspicion of being under the influence of a controlled substance and resisting officers and was released into the saints care at a hospital early on the morning of aug 19 he returned to practice on wednesday graham has not spoken publicly about his arrest and declined to meet with media after the game but the saints provided a comment from graham about his performance it just reminded me of all the amazing moments i had here in front of these fans  so many special moments and wins graham said im looking forward to continuing to capitalize and let this feeling become even bigger the texans opened scoring with strouds 3 yard pass to collins capping a drive began on the new orleans 43 after a 26 yard punt return by texans rookie  rushed four times for 27 yards during the series stroud did a really good job this week houston coach demeco ryans said the ball

for the colts richardson rushed for two touchdowns and minshew threw for 171 yards and a td in the first win for coach shane steichen who was hired in february after spending the last two seasons as philadelphias offensive coordinator there are certain things that we dont do with gardner that we do with anthony steichen said but as far as the passing game i thought he was efficient and operated at a high level just a great player a great veteran guy he prepares like hes the starter but also does a heck of a job helping anthony out throughout the week the colts led by 18 at halftime and managed only a field goal in the second half but their dominant start was enough to snap an eight game skid dating to last season it was their first win since nov 13 at las vegas i told him at halftime im going to hold it down for you minshew said of a conversation with richardson everybody follows him hes the leader of our team and i was happy to be able to fill in and help when i could but im going to continue to help him and support him as much as i can richardson gave the colts 1 1 an early lead when on their first drive fumbled when he was sacked by  and it was recovered by indianapolis at the 15 richardson made it 14 0 when he ran 15 yards for the score on the next play the rookie qb who was selected by indy with the no 4 pick in the nfl draft hit the back of his head when he was pushed down  but he popped right up to celebrate he remained in the game for two more possessions before going to the medical tent and then to the locker room steichen said he was injured on that second touchdown run and that he didnt report the injury to the staff until after he played two more drives it looked like a fluke thing on that one but hopefully it doesnt continue to happen steichen said defensive tackle presented steichen with a game ball to commemorate his first nfl win hes trying to play it all cool but then when he gave him the team ball his voice was cracking so he liked that minshew said stroud the second overall pick in the draft threw for 384 yards and two touchdowns but he was sacked six times and hit nine other times playing behind a line filled with backups the texans 0 2 lost four starters on the line during camp and were also without star left tackle on sunday because of a knee injury guys are still going out trying to do the best they can do coach demeco ryans said doing the job that we ask them to do of course we would like it better dont want to see the quarterback get hit but i thought the offense took a move in the right direction today got better overall the texans closed to 31 20 on a 23 yard touchdown reception by rookie with about 10 minutes to go it was the first career touchdown for the third round pick from the university of houston houston got a stop after that but wouldnt get any closer after missing a long field goal on the next possession stroud threw his first career touchdown pass when he connected with for a 12 yard score that cut the lead to 14 7 with about three minutes left in the first quarter collins finished with seven receptions for a career high 146 yards minshew took over for richardson in the second quarter and orchestrated a 76 yard drive capped by an 11 yard scoring run by that made it 21 7 the colts pushed it to 28 10 when scored on a 4 yard pass just before halftime richardson is the third qb in nfl history with three rushing touchdowns in his first two games joining daunte culpepper and jack thompson richardson who is 21 years and 118 days old is also the youngest quarterback with two rushing touchdowns in a game filled in for tunsil and had a holding penalty in the fourth quarter that negated a touchdown by dell the texans settled for a field goal on

disappointed with the loss but knows that his return to the field means a lot to many people who followed his fight it was not to be satisfied with just coming back but strive to be the best in coming

up in prime time and its only going to get better for him threw for 114 yards with an interception and struggled to move the offense before leaving late in the third quarter with a knee injury the loss ends a two game winning streak for the steelers 2 2 and will likely increase the pressure on third year offensive coordinator matt canada after another subpar offensive performance threw for 18 yards after pickett left weve got to make some changes pittsburgh coach mike tomlin said that was an ugly product we put out there today were not going to do the same things and hope for a different outcome well put those changes in place in our preparation this week tomlin said he wasnt sure of the extent of picketts injury and that theyd know more later in the week the steelers scored six

and the rest of the steelers werent able to get to stroud and finished with zero sacks we were out of gaps watt said we didnt tackle in the backfield and that combination leads to what you saw out

yard catch on third and 4 to get the steelers to the 8 yard line but their drive stalled after that and they settled for a 23 yard field goal to make it 16 6 the steelers went for it on fourth and 1

learning how finish jacksonville coach doug pederson said im really proud of our guys for the way they hung in there today  the second overall pick in the draft thew for 304 yards and two touchdowns as houstons three game winning streak was snapped he has 3266 yards passing this season to move past 3224 for most in nfl history by a rookie in his first 11 games he also became the first rookie in nfl history to throw for 300 yards in four consecutive games weve got to be cleaner and execute better stroud said the texans led by one after a touchdown run by stroud midway through the third quarter lawrence responded by throwing a a and hitting ridley for the 2 point conversion to make it 21 14 tacked on a field goal early in the fourth quarter to pad the lead and jacksonvilles defense stopped houston on fourth down but mcmanus missed from 55 yards with seven minutes left stroud then orchestrated a 55 yard drive capped by a 17 yard touchdown reception by  to cut the lead to 24 21 with just over five minutes to go the texans got a stop but couldnt move the ball and settled for the long field goal attempt on fourth and 12 instead of giving stroud and the offense one more shot i felt like that was the right decision for us to kick the ball coach demeco ryans said i thought he had good range from there just didnt make the kick  intercepted lawrence near midfield early in the second half it was the second straight game with an interception for the third overall pick in the 2022 draft the texans had third and goal at the 1 on the ensuing drive stroud faked a handoff to fullback and to put houston on top 14 13 jacksonville retook the lead on its next drive aided by two pass interference penalties on cornerback  the first one gave the jaguars a first down at the 8 and the second gave them a new set of downs at the 1 mcmanus added a 53 yard field goal early in the fourth quarter to make it 24 14 lawrence scored on a 1 yard touchdown with about 10 minutes left in the second quarter to put the jags ahead 10 0 dernest johnson took a screen pass 42 yards earlier in the drive stroud connected with on a 33 yard catch on the next drive to get the texans to the jacksonville 8 two plays later he found for a 7 yard td pass to cut the lead to 10 7 jacksonville pushed the lead to 13 7 on mcmanus 48 yard field goal about 2 12 minutes before halftime the texans had a chance to cut the lead with 25 seconds left in the first half but ammendolas 49 yard attempt was wide right there were 10 seconds left in the half when lawrence found for a 57 yard reception but he was pushed out of bounds at the 1 yard line with 1 second left the jaguars went for it instead of attempting a field goal but  was swarmed by multiple texans and stopped for no gain it was a real easy decision  i was going for it the whole way pederson said you make a play like that and you have them back on the ropes injuries jacksonville lt left with a knee injury in the first quarter

streak with a 30 6 victory over the texans on sunday winning is always fun and thats what we want right there wilson said thats what we want every game to look like wilson was 27 of 36 for 301 yards  his third career game of 300 or more yards  after sitting in favor of the since waived  and that came despite wilson facing consistent pressure all game and being sacked four times the second half i thought zach probably played the best game of his career coach robert saleh said i thought he was outstanding today and caught touchdown passes and ran for a score for the jets 5 8 who reached 30 points for just the second time this season and first since beating denver 31 21 in week 5 wilson when the athletic reported he was reluctant to step back into his role as the starter something he denied later in the week saleh and several teammates defended wilson who has been benched three times in his three seasons but on sunday  especially in the second half  wilson played up to the expectations of being the no 2 overall pick in the 2021 draft i mean he balled man said  who caught nine passes for 108 yards zach went crazy today stroud left with 630 remaining when he was hit by  fell backward and his head appeared to bounce off the metlife stadium turf he was examined briefly on the sideline before he walked to the locker room stroud whos in the concussion protocol was done for the game and replaced him hes really like the light of our team tight end said hes a guy who came in here and brought a lot of moxie a lot of swag to see him go down is tough but its football the next man got to be up and ready to go stroud who came in leading the nfl in yards passing was unable to do much against an aggressive jets defense he was just 10 of 23 for a season low 91 yards before leaving with the head injury the texans 7 6 finished with just 135 total yards and went 1 for 12 on third down now theyll have to see if stroud will be ready for next sundays game against afc south

wilson found cobb for a 15 yard touchdown the suddenly td happy jets struck again on their next drive with gipson taking a handoff and zipping into the end zone for a 9 yard score that made it 14 0  new yorks largest lead of the season to that point  with 431 left in the third quarter new york was driving again on its next possession but zach wilson scrambled for 11 yards before knocked the ball out of the quarterbacks hands and recovered stroud and the texans took advantage quickly moving downfield on passes of 26 yards to and 23 to brevin jordan a pass interference call on in the end zone put the ball at the 1 and ran up the middle for a touchdown after missed the extra point zach wilson and the jets bounced back from the turnover by marching down the field on their next possession a wide open hall took a pass 3 yards for a touchdown to make it 21 6 with 927 remaining its easy to ignore all the noise when youre able to do that zach wilson said sluggish start neither team could get anything going in the first half in the driving rain the first time there was a scoreless first two quarters since san francisco beat washington 9 0 in week 7 of the 2019 season it was the first time

the go ahead touchdown on a 3 yard td run with 620 to play and the texans came up with a late stop for a 23 19 victory over indianapolis on saturday night everybodys fighting till that last play thats what its about coach demeco ryans said as the after earning their first playoff berth since 2019 we punched our ticket now the waiting begins houston 10 7 either will be one of the afcs three wild card teams or host a wild card weekend game as the afc south champs  if jacksonville loses at tennessee indianapolis 9 8 was eliminated from the playoff chase with its third loss in five weeks it hasnt made the postseason since 2020 reaching the postseason sure hasnt been easy for houston with a new head coach a new quarterback a short handed receiving corps and needing a win at a venue where the texans had only won four times in the previous 20 seasons still houston finished the job saturday with a strong performance  and a little help from indy to on the texans first play hours later colts running back was wide open when he dropped a pass on fourth and 1 from the houston 15 with 106 to go we all have plays that we want back just because its the last one makes it that much more significant colts quarterback said about the fourth down call i told him goodson id throw that ball every time i trust him stroud finished 20 of 26 with no turnovers and hooked up with collins nine times for 195 yards and the score stroud has with a passer rating of 1341 for indy it was an odd night full of close calls in the first half the colts struggled to move the ball struggled to contain stroud and rarely tried to stretch the field in the second half they leaned heavily on  who had his best game of the season  30 carries for 188 yards and a 49 yard td run early in the third quarter that led to a nifty 2 point conversion from minshew to that tied it at 14 but he injured his ankle and foot in the second half went briefly to the locker room then returned for indys final series only to be out of the game on coach shane steichen said that was by design steichens other big gamble didnt pay off either he opted to try a 57 yard field goal midway through the third quarter that would have broken the 14 14 tie but s kick hit the right upright and five plays later made a 51 yarder to give houston a 17 14 lead indy tied it on gays 35 yard field goal on the ensuing drive but stroud responded with a 12 play 73 yard drive that took more than seven minutes off the clock and ended with minshew was 13 of 24 for 141 yards it wasnt pretty but it was gritty ryans said we fought and found a way to get it done strange night the colts thought they would open the fourth quarter facing third and 1 from the houston 24 but steichen challenged the call when the challenge resulted in a first down the refs put 45 seconds back on the clock and the players who had just changed ends had down field again for one more play to finish the third quarter then they changed ends again after the play then in the fourth quarter a flag was thrown because indy had too many players on the field after the snap the refs waved off the penalty and announced they would have a do over by the numbers texans houston got one sack to give it 46 this season a franchise record  fairbairn missed an extra point for the first time this season following the go ahead score  the texans improved to 4 4 on the road colts caught three passes for 48 yards giving him the franchise record 68 for a rookie  taylor had his first 100 yard game since november 2022  minshew finished this season with a career best

back also sat out de left with an ankle injury in the third quarter but later returned colts taylor wasnt the only significant injury indy suffered rt left with an injured knee and did not return and

it was an emotional day for bigsby officially he logged seven carries for 13 yards and had no receptions but the one touch that didnt show up in the box score nearly turned him into the week 1 goat after casually catching a ball he thought was an incompletion colts linebacker punched it out and the jags froze defensive tackle alertly scooped up the bouncing ball sprinted 26 yards and stretched the ball across the goal line for his second career td and a 21 17 third quarter lead  perhaps the most bizarre strip sack of buckners career we preach getting on all loose balls colts coach shane steichen said after his first game as a head coach it looked like a sack or incomplete pass zaire made that play go getting the punch out then seeing buck go down and score it was good to see bigsby made sure the jags didnt trail long jamal agnews 48 yard punt return set up jacksonville at the colts 46 yard line three series later allowing bigsby to cap a 10 play drive for a 24 21 lead with 514

start a season opener in nfl history was 24 of 37 with 223 yards one td and the interception while leading the colts with 10 carries for 40 yards and another score before hurting his left knee on a run near the goal line he watched the final 58 seconds from the sideline i did it in the first quarter he said i cant remember exactly what play it was but i had a zone read and hit it on the turf lawrence was 24 of 32 with 241 yards and two scores and had eight catchesa for 101 yards and the jags first score etienne had 18 carries for 77 yards hes back ridley played well in his first game since oct 24 2021 he missed the rest of that season after telling the he needed to work on his mental health he was suspended the entire 2022 season for violating the leagues gambling policy eventually ridley was traded to the jags and said earlier this week he didnt expect to be rusty he caught seven passes for 92 yards and the score in the first half i worked so hard in camp i just love this team these guys and i want to help them win games the right call jags coach doug pederson agreed to turn over the play calling duties this season  a former colts assistant and the brother of

slipped and limped his way through the final 20 minutes of regulation sunday then the gutsy 35 year old quarterback showed everyone hes still gritty enough to finish what he started after opening the game with four straight scoring drives and then watching a 23 point lead evaporate stafford played through a painful hip injury and to record breaking rookie receiver for a 29 23 overtime victory over the  the hardest part was it was kind of shutting down the leg a little bit to where youd step and push and normal leg it was step and push and then not normal the muscles were kind of shutting down said stafford who twice fell to the ground on his own but i just kept going i knew it was going to be one of those things that was painfunction so as long as i could keep it going on the sideline i was going to stay in there he kept playing despite the hurting body the alternative consecutive road losses would have been even more painful because the weekly travel log included two round trip flights from the west coast to the midwest totaling nearly 8500 miles plus stafford nacua and the defense had los angeles in complete command for 2 12 quarters stafford finished 27 of 40 with 319 yards one td and one interception for 163 yards and his first career touchdown and now has more receptions 39 and yards 501 through his first four games than any player in nfl history he also became the first player since harlon hill  1954 with three 100 yard efforts in his first four games but when colts defensive lineman broke free late in the third quarter and drove stafford into the ground things began to unravel on the next play the hobbled stafford was picked off with the rams leading 23 8 we had tried to run a keeper but the defensive end jetted up the field and landed with what seemed to be full body weight but was viewed otherwise stafford said it just started chirping right then suddenly staffords precise throws and nifty third down conversions were off colts rookie quarterback took full advantage he scored on a 1 yard run to trim the deficit to 23 15 with 1145 left in regulation he threw a 5 yard td pass to with 156 to go and followed that with a perfect rollout and easy toss to  to tie the score at 23 richardson even had a chance to win it in regulation only to watch three straight passes fall incomplete sending the colts 2 2 into their second straight overtime game i was just telling the guys lets just move the ball and focus on each and every play and try not to rush it richardson said when we were in those last few minutes partially it was on me you know just getting too excited trying to go win the game but you learn from it even at less than full strength though stafford didnt make that mistake he methodically led the rams on a 75 yard scoring drive hooking up with his new favorite target on third and 4 so he could start getting treatment it was going to have shut all the way down to not keep playing stafford said once the ball was snapped there was enough adrenaline to kind of get you through it throw it and we complete it or get tackled or whatever and it starts talking to you again but it was good it was a great win richardson finished 11 of 25 with 200 yards and one interception as the colts lost their sixth straight at home rushed 25 times for 103 yards and two scores as the rams won their third straight at indy and their fourth in a row in the series rookie sensations rams only needed one catch to surpass anquan boldin 30 for most receptions in a players first four games and was the sixth player in

the big one and then obviously this week he got the shoulder on that play thats stuff that youve got to look at be smart with and its part of the game and you dont want it to happen the game itself

on 23 carries and posting his second 100 yard game in three weeks catching two passes for 30 yards and sliding to keep the clock running instead of scoring a third td just before the 2 minute warning and it came against the leagues no 4 ranked run defense and a team that had held 10 straight opponents to fewer than 100 yards and that went 20 games between allowing a 100 yard rusher it seemed like whenever they needed to run they did titans coach mike vrabel said we watched short runs turn into big plays its certainly frustrating our goal on defense is to set the edge build a wall then swarm and tackle we just werent consistent doing that the inability to contain moss wasnt tennessees only problem while went 23 of 34 with 264 yards eight timesa for a season best 140 yards he threw the

indy a 7 3 lead started the second halfa with a 19 yard td run to give the titans a 13 10 lead moss answered by powering across from 3 yards out on the ensuing series to make it 17 13 the colts put it

slow to get up look is there a little bit of risk there to run your quarterback yes pederson said but at the same time the reward is you get the first down and you stay on the field and ice the game in those situations definitely wouldnt change the scenario or the situation we can coach that a little bit better and ask him maybe to go down a little bit sooner lawrence got checked out on the sideline and stayed on the field for postgame handshakes and interviews im feeling ok he said going to get it checked out tonight and see whats going on i feel pretty good walking around all right cant really say much now i want to make sure everything checks out the jaguars pretty much had the victory in hand by the third quarter when lawrence connected with a for a 10 yard strike and put jacksonville ahead 31 6 lawrence also for a 29 yard scorea in the second etienne scored on and early in the same quarter the colts 3 3 had hoped to end a head scratching road skid against jacksonville

the early fumble and  and getting picks we got ourselves in a hole there with the turnovers indy coach shane steichen said we got to do better there it starts with myself doing a better job there  ive

14 10 after the colts ran into punter aj cole extending a drive that eventually ended with midway through the third quarter but indy added three second half field goals from  the final one set up by two penalties against  a pass interference call on third down and an offside call that negated gays kick that bounced off the right upright gay took advantage of his second chance to make it 23 13 i

losing by double digits for the third time this season was directed not at the jaguars but the officiating wide receiver pointed to a series of calls in the first half  namely a rare offensive offside on a field goal attempt that took three points off the board and the hit on pickett by gotsis  that played a significant factor in the outcome they were calling some stupid stuff johnson said they

four turnovers i think you have got to feel the pain and embarrassment of today lawrence said its terrible its one of the worst games ive probably played in my career  we couldnt do anything right but

shanahan said if we had a chance to do it i was going to try to do it for him its a little nerve racking last thing i want to do is get him hurt  we got close wish we could have done it for him but i think that was a pretty big accomplishment to do it for 17 games straight added mccaffrey it means a lot to me for them to keep me in the game at the end there and try to get me that record but ill

change to a play hes scored on previously near the goal line they trust me with those things and it didnt work lawrence said ive got to take accountability for that and at the end of the day thats on me if i decide to do it and dont get in its one of those plays where if you do it you better score and i didnt its unfortunate the 9 8 missed a chance at their first back to back afc south titles

won three straight nobody came here and expected us to lose obviously allen said ran for a season high 153 yards and a touchdown even with the jaguars putting eight and nine defenders close to the line that helped the titans 6 11 finish on a winning note after they had been eliminated from playoff contention earlier than at any prior point in vrabels six season tenure this win snapped a three game skid and also gave them a measure of revenge after the jaguars kept the titans from a third straight afc south title in last seasons finale henry fresh off being voted to his fourth pro bowl got a huge ovation when introduced last he turned 30 on thursday and this is his last game under contract the two time nfl rushing champ put on a show henry ran for an 18 yard touchdown to put tennessee

consecutive drives in the second quarter to help them take a 21 13 lead into halftime safety got his hands under a ball dropped by engram for the titans fifth interception this season finished the

you cant take it for granted he can read the coverages stop in the windows and be on the same page as me yet their big half only left the chiefs leading 24 17 because the chargers were getting some big plays of their own after they evened the score with a field goal of their own kelley got loose for a 49 yard touchdown run early in the second quarter and after herbert connected with palmer for 60 yards down the middle of the field the los angeles quarterback found tight end in the end zone for a touchdown given all the first half offense the second half was mostly a dud both teams put

sunday at deutsche bank park he got those knees up and was rolling down the field mahomes said huge play that obviously mattered a ton in the game mahomes threw two touchdown passes and the chiefs 7 2

their tail off and we got the win mahomes said three chiefs players combined to put kansas city up 21 0 just before halftime on one of the top defensive plays of the season so far and it came at the expense of former teammate  with the dolphins driving late in the first half cornerback stuffed hill on a short pass in the flat and stripped the ball from the all pro receiver scooped it up and after

methodically build a 10 point halftime lead monday night the eagles and coa over the final 30 minutes overcame a poor start in a cold driving rain to run for a pair of touchdowns and his go ahead tush push in the fourth quarter allowed the eagles to walk away with a 21 17 victory we werent thinking hey were coming up here to avenge a loss eagles coach nick sirianni said afterward thats a different magnitude of game that was for everything so were just pleased to get the win tonight besides sirianni said they aint giving us the rings back i know that still the eagles 9 1 became the first team to win at least nine of their first 10 games in consecutive seasons since the colts in 2005 06 and they did it by beating former coach andy reid for the first time in five tries since he landed in kansas city eagles center also got the best of little brother for the first time the chiefs tight end could have used some luck from pop star and  who had to miss the game  he fumbled the ball away in the red zone in the fourth quarter when kansas city was trying to extend a 17 14 lead the chiefs still had a chance with less than 2 minutes to go converting on fourth down and getting help from a roughing the passer penalty but a perfectly placed ball from mahomes went right through the hands of for a would be 51 yard touchdown and the eagles stopped kansas city on fourth down to put the game away this is a growing moment for us as a team overall chiefs defensive tackle said hurts threw for just 150 yards with a pick but he made the plays mahomes could not in the second half he also got some help from  who ran for 76 yards and a score and  who caught six balls for 99 yards i dont think we played clean tonight i dont think we played to our standard hurts said but i think the one thing you cant quantify is the resilience that a team has and the ability to see through things and this team has that it was only the ninth time that two teams that played in the super bowl met in the regular season the following year and the champion had won the previous four matchups the last to lose was dallas against buffalo during the 1993 season mahomes was held to 177 yards passing with two touchdowns and an interception in the end zone added 89 yards rushing for the chiefs who couldnt overcome their two red zone turnovers and a plethora of penalties i think offensively mahomes said im just not where i want to be at this point in the season  when the eagles blew a 10 point halftime lead the chiefs took a 17 7 lead to the break monday night it was knotted 7 all after hurts and mahomes traded first quarter touchdown throws and it was still tied when mahomes hit kelce on third down for the go ahead td with 145 left and when the eagles got the ball back sacks by and made them give it right back with 44 seconds remaining plenty of time for mahomes to get the chiefs within range for to add a 43 yard field goal but for all the praise the chiefs get for their prolific offense theyve been abysmal in the second half this season scoring a league low 53 points entering monday night and after two quick punts to start the half philadelphia finally capitalized on the good field position marching downfield before hurts finished the drive with a 10 yard touchdown run the chiefs kept beating themselves  and the eagles kept taking advantage along with penalties that derailed their first two drives of the second half kelce fumbled the ball away at the philadelphia 8 early in the fourth quarter and when the chiefs got the ball back and had to punt a few minutes later was unable to down the ball at the philadelphia 1 resulting in a touchback that gave hurts and co some breathing room they proceeded to go 80 yards the other way and hurts sneak gave philadelphia the lead for good in the fourth quarter its the resiliency and togetherness that really stood out to me tonight sirianni said and i cant say enough about the defense i cant say enough about the job our defense

the super bowl for the fourth time in five years with a 17 10 victory in the afc championship game sunday kelce caught 11 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown and now the big question at next months super bowl in las vegas is whether his girlfriend taylor swift will be able to make it there in the middle of her tour the pop star was on hand again sunday and the 34 year old kelce was at his best the chiefs are still the chiefs said kelce who broke jerry rices career record for receptions in the postseason and believe it  youve got to fight for your right to party believe it baby were going to las vegas kansas city 14 6 will face either san francisco or detroit on feb 11 and a win would make the chiefs the first team to win it all in back to back seasons since the 19 years ago swifts presence has turned the chiefs into even more of a glamour team than they already were but its been more of a blue collar performance on the field this season aside from kelce mahomes hasnt had the receiving playmakers hes enjoyed in years past instead the defense has been a big part of why kansas city won the afc west and eventually prevailed in two straight road playoff games against buffalo and baltimore to win the conference its been a heck of a year weve been underdogs the last few games mahomes said we never feel like underdogs weve got a lot of guys on this team that know how to win when the playoffs get around theyre here to make it happen and now were in the super bowl the jobs not done the chiefs led 17 7 at halftime and s 43 yard field goal with 234 to play was the only scoring of the second half baltimore kicked deep after that and on third and 9 mahomes connected with  one of his most maligned receivers  on a 32 yard pass that sealed the game mahomes went 30 of 39 for 241 yards and a touchdown jackson could win his second mvp after leading baltimore to the leagues best record and point differential during the regular season but the ravens allowed touchdowns on the first two kansas city possessions and appeared a bit panicky at times after that baltimore 14 5 made undisciplined mistakes all game while kansas city looked the part of the team making its sixth straight appearance in the conference title game with the ravens down by 10 in the third quarter rookie caught a 54 yard pass to the kansas city 10  then was flagged for taunting after the play moments later he fumbled near the goal line and the ravens ended up with no points that was one of several frustrating moments for baltimore fans whose city was hosting an afc championship game for the first time since january 1971 when the colts beat the oakland raiders jackson went 20 of 37 for 272 yards and a touchdown but baltimore never really exploited its perceived advantage on the ground jackson raced under one of his own tipped passes in the first half for a 13 yard reception but he also turned the ball over twice including a forced pass into heavy coverage that was picked off in the end zone with 645 left in the game jackson fell to 2 4 as a starter in the postseason despite having been the top seed in the afc twice he made a few sensational individual plays but the ravens had trouble moving the ball otherwise mahomes meanwhile competed his first 11 pass attempts and although the ravens largely shut kansas city down after that the damage was done on a rainy day in baltimore there was some chippy behavior before the game which included ravens defensive back and a group of kansas city players having to be separated then the chiefs forced a three and out on the games first drive and went 86 yards for th e opening touchdown kelce caught a 13 yard pass from mahomes over the middle on fourth and 2 then the star tight end beat all pro safety for a 19 yard touchdown to make it 7 0 jackson answered in his own spectacular way he broke free for a 21 yard run when baltimore went for it on fourth and 1 from its 34 then the star quarterback ducked out of a near sack by  retreated a bit farther back and threw a 30 yard scoring strike to flowers who celebrated with teammates by doing the swag surf dance that swift and chiefs fans did at a recent game kansas city was unbothered mahomes drove his team 75 yards in 902  with the help of an acrobatic diving catch by kelce on one third down toss  and capped the 16 play march with a 2 yard touchdown run the chiefs actually missed chances to extend their lead a sack by forced a fumble by jackson that gave kansas city the ball at the baltimore 33 but kelce was marked just short on a third down catch and pacheco was stopped on the ensuing fourth down at the 13 after a couple of personal fouls on baltimore helped kansas city cross midfield late in the half the chiefs were flagged for back to back holding calls the second of which wiped out a 33 yard screen pass to for what would have been a touchdown a 9 yard pass to kelce put kansas city in position for harrison butkers 52 yard field goal that made it 17 7 injuries omenihu left with a knee injury and star defensive tackle was shaken up in the fourth quarter for the chiefs up next chiefs kansas city could face a rematch with a detroit team it lost to 21 20 in the season opener the chiefs have not faced the 49ers this season ravens baltimore knows it can win a lot of games with jackson and his talented supporting cast but getting past the chiefs seems

wafted down the tunnel beneath arrowhead stadium straight from the in the celebratory visiting locker room to the despondent home locker room of the  for one the scent of success for the other the stench of a sloppy mess taking advantage of two defensive touchdowns for the second straight week and riding an aggressive mindset that shut down and the rest of the kansas city offense the raiders held off the chiefs 20 14 on monday to not only deny their longtime afc west rival another division crown but keep their postseason hopes alive that was one of our mantras raiders interim coach antonio pierce said afterward by any means necessary that meant big defensive tackle returning a fumble 8 yards for a touchdown and taking an interception 33 yards for another score 7 seconds later it meant never completing a pass after the first quarter yet also never making the same mistakes that mahomes made for kansas city on a soggy christmas day the raiders 7 8 became the first nfl team since 2000 to win without completing a pass after the first quarter and only the fifth team to beat the chiefs at arrowhead stadium without scoring an offensive touchdown obviously this was a huge game its a rivalry game oconnell said we play them twice a year every year so to come into arrowhead stadium and win a game like this its pretty awesome its pretty special for our guys kansas city 9 6 hardly helped its cause along with allowing the two defensive tds missed a chip shot field goal penalties and dropped passes were again a problem and twice they failed to convert on fourth down in the second half they played a better game than we did today said chiefs coach andy reid whose team has lost three of four on offense we struggled thats my responsibility to make sure we put the guys in the right position to make plays and that didnt happen the way we wanted it to i take full responsibility for the way we played offensively there the chiefs still had a chance in the closing minutes monday to clinch their eighth straight afc west title and keep their hopes alive for the no 1 seed but after mahomes hit for a touchdown with 242 to go the raiders broke loose for a 43 yard gain picking up a first down that allowed them to run out the clock mahomes finished 27 of 44 for 235 yards and the interception he nearly threw a second but it was overturned upon review the raiders playing without injured running back  won despite a dismal day from their offense white ran for 145 yards but much of that came on the final possession oconnell was just 9 of 21 for 62 yards the raiders were 0 for 3 in the red zone and 3 for 12 on third down and they had seven fewer first downs than kansas city all that mattered was the score though thats why its a team sport oconnell said it was a team win reid had spent the past few weeks lamenting the mental mistakes that kept costing the defending super bowl champs and they made more of them monday than they had in any game this season they went three and out on consecutive series to start a game for only the second time with mahomes at quarterback they were held to minus 18 yards in the first quarter the second worst total for the club since at least 1991 and the reigning league mvp was sacked twice in those two series while more offensive penalties only made matters worse the chiefs took the lead early when took a direct snap 12 yards for a touchdown and las vegas gave the ball right back after a punt but when pacheco again took a direct snap and tried to hand to mahomes they bobbled the exchange and the 315 pound and run for the touchdown on the next offensive play for kansas city whose 33 yard return gave las vegas its fourth defensive td in the past two weeks along with a 17 7 lead over its longtime divisional nemesis then jones appeared to play when he faked giving the ball to a kid wearing chiefs clothes in the crowd the defensive scores made it 17 7 and it was still that way when butker missed his field goal before halftime the raiders added one in the third quarter and that was all the scoring they needed to end a six game skid against kansas city stats and streaks the raiders have five defensive tds this season their most since 2005  the first quarter was the best by the raiders defense since holding the chargers to minus 21 yards on dec 1 1991  had six catches to reach 74 for the season breaking the chiefs rookie record of 70 set by dwayne bowe in 2007  had three sacks for the raiders injuries chiefs pacheco went into the concussion protocol in the third quarter when his helmet popped off and he

way through  the managed to handle the adversity well saturday night handled the quite well too mahomes threw for 262 yards found eight times for 130 yards and a touchdown and made several daring runs for key first downs pounded over the frozen turf for 89 yards and another score and the chiefs shut down a prolific miami offense in a 26 7 victory in the wild card round of the playoffs added four field goals for the reigning super bowl champs who appear to be warming up for another run guys came with that attitude that mentality  we knew it was going to be cold mahomes said all week we were preaching lets come in there with that fire and just get after it and see what happens meanwhile the injury depleted dolphins 11 7 looked nothing like the same dynamic offense that led the league in yards was pressured relentlessly by the nfls second ranked defense wide receiver had a 53 yard td catch but was otherwise shut down and the dolphins finished with 264 yards in all they have not won at arrowhead stadium since nov 6 2011 nor won a playoff game since dec 30 2000 losing is never fun and when the stakes are higher  when its playoff time  you feel that maybe 10 times more said tagovailoa who was just 20 of 39 for 199 yards passing with an interception weve got to live with that loss the chiefs get to live with another win in their 15th consecutive home playoff game not counting a trio of super bowls that netted them two lombardi trophies but they will head to buffalo next week if the bills beat the steelers on monday in by a blizzard otherwise the chiefs will host houston earlier saturday everybody was out there playing for each other rice said we just put the weather to the side and knew that our opponent didnt want to be out there just as much as we didnt and we showed our love for the game it was minus 4 degrees fahrenheit minus 20 celsius at kickoff easily setting a record for the coldest game at arrowhead stadium but it was wind gusts whipping through at more than 25 mph 40 kph and driving the wind chill to a bone rattling minus 27 degrees that made the weather truly miserable for just about everyone that included pop star taylor swift who once again turned up to see her boyfriend chiefs tight end  she at least got to watch from an enclosed suite most fans bundled up outside in parkas ski goggles and snowpants and players huddled around heaters on the sidelines as if they were oases in the cold the national weather service even issued a warning for what it called dangerously cold weather that had blanketed the midwest in fact the cold may have made mahomes helmet brittle enough that a hit in the third quarter knocked a chunk of the plastic shell from it once officials saw the fist sized hole they made mahomes get a backup helmet from the bench we have to talk about where we store the backup mahomes said with a smile it was like frozen the weather didnt seem to bother hill who was playing in kansas city for the first time since his old team traded him to miami two years ago the leagues leading receiver warmed up in a short sleeve shirt then proceeded to scorch the stout chiefs defense and all pro cornerback for a long touchdown reception midway through the first half its where it all started for me hill said afterward just being back on the field brought back so many memories the dolphins otherwise struggled on offense though just as they did in a 21 14 loss to the chiefs in november in germany they were just 1 for 12 on third down and they never put together a truly sustained drive until the fourth quarter we knew they were going to put a lot of attention toward our receivers dolphins coach mike mcdaniel said we thought we had the right plan and obviously it wasnt and hats off to them for executing their plan in the most important time on offense the chiefs scored on four of their six first half drives mahomes capped the first with his td toss to rice and while ensuing drives continually fizzled in the red zone butker added a trio of field goals to help kansas city forge a 16 3 lead butker was phenomenal reid said that was like kicking a block of ice the chiefs added another field goal in the third quarter but it was still a two possession game in the fourth when the dolphins appeared to force another field goal but a late flag on for roughing the passer on third down gave kansas city a fresh set of downs and pacheco plowed into the end zone moments later to give the chiefs a 26 7 lead the dolphins never threatened down the stretch in their 11th straight loss when game time temps are 40 degrees or less far

peat first they had to become the first back to back champions in 19 years mahomes made sure of it leading another super comeback on the nfls biggest stage in americas showcase capital mahomes threw a 3 yard touchdown pass to mecole hardman in overtime and the chiefs rallied to beat the 25 22 on sunday becoming the nfls ninth repeat super bowl champs with pop star from a suite the chiefs captured their third title in five years a run that puts them among the leagues greatest franchises well you know the goal has always been to get three kelce screamed on stage after  but we couldnt get here without getting that two and having that target on our back all year  how about that we get a chance to do it three times in a row the nfls first super bowl in las vegas was a sloppy mistake filled affair that was mostly boring until the back and forth fourth quarter and ot it was the second of 58 super bowls to be tied after regulation and the first played under new overtime rules that ensured both teams got the ball the chiefs 15 6 trailed 22 19 after kicked a 27 yard field goal on the first possession of overtime but mahomes rallied the chiefs completing another impressive comeback in a rematch of the super bowl four years ago mahomes ran 8 yards on fourth and 1 to keep the chiefs chances alive and then scrambled 19 yards to set up the winning score which came 1457 into the extra period  just before what would have been the second ot with all the adversity weve been through this season to come through tonight  im proud of the guys said mahomes who earned his third super bowl mvp award this is awesome legendary after he connected with a wide open hardman the chiefs ran on the field as red and yellow confetti fell onto the turf mahomes and reid are now halfway to tom brady and bill belichick who won six championships in 20 years together with the and were the most recent team to go back to back following the 2003 04 seasons the 28 year old mahomes becomes the fourth starting qb to win three super bowls  joining brady joe montana terry bradshaw and troy aikman  and second youngest i am going to celebrate tonight celebrate at the parade and then work my way to get back in this game next year mahomes said i am going to do whatever i can to be back in this game next year three peat the most excitement in the first half came when a frustrated kelce on the sideline knocking the chiefs 65 year old coach a few steps back after teammate fumbled inside the red zone during the second quarter you guys saw that kelce said im going to keep it between us unless my micd up tells the world i was just telling him how much i loved him the action picked up after a crucial blunder by san franciscos special teams set up mahomes 16 yard td pass to for a 13 10 lead and the 49ers 14 6 answered but they couldnt make enough plays denying mr irrelevant an opportunity to go from last pick in the 2022 nfl draft to super bowl champion we have the offense to score touchdowns and i failed to put the team in position to do that purdy said niners wide receiver threw a td pass and caught one joining eagles quarterback six years ago as the only players to do both in the super bowl after moodys 53 yard field goal gave the niners a 19 16 lead with 153 remaining mahomes and kelce went to work mahomes connected with kelce for a 22 yard gain to set up harrison butkers tying kick a 29 yarder with 3 seconds left a holding call on kansas citys extended san franciscos opening drive of overtime and purdy made key throws to drive the 49ers to the chiefs 9 but san francisco settled for a field goal purdy and the niners jumped ahead 10 0 but thats no big deal for mahomes and the chiefs in the super bowl theyve trailed by 10 points in all three of their victories including last years 38 35 win over philadelphia mahomes wasnt at his best early and threw an interception but with the game on the line he was a magician once again he finished 34 of 46 for 333 yards and two tds the chiefs were hardly dominant during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the afcs no 3 seed they won at buffalo and at baltimore in the postseason  the first road playoff games of mahomes career  and entered the super bowl as 2 12 point underdogs according to  the kansas city chiefs are never underdogs just know that mahomes said they became the first team to win consecutive super bowls as underdogs the were slight favorites a year ago the game turned when san franciscos ray ray mccloud couldnt scoop a punt that hit teammate s leg and the chiefs recovered at the 49ers 16 leading to mahomes go ahead td pass to valdes scantling the niners answered on the next possession with purdy tossing a 10 yard td pass to jennings for a 16 13 lead moodys extra point was blocked niners coach kyle shanahan gambled on fourth and 3 from the chiefs 15 passing up a chance for a tying field goal purdy hit for a 4 yard gain and then found jennings for the score shanahan resorted to trickery for the only touchdown of the first half jennings a wide receiver who had never thrown a pass in an nfl game tossed a 21 yard td to mccaffrey he was hit as  but mccaffrey snagged it and sprinted to the end zone shanahan fell to 0 2 as a head coach in super bowls and 0 3 overall including a loss when he was offensive coordinator for atlanta that was the game in which brady and the patriots rallied from a 28 3 deficit to win in ot when you go against guys like tom brady and pat mahomes you never feel comfortable with a lead those guys are two of the best to ever play the game shanahan said there were plenty of stars in the building as the nfl brought its biggest game to this gambling mecca  once a taboo idea jay z lebron james and paul mccartney were among the celebrities in the crowd post malone sang america the beautiful reba mcentire performed the national anthem and at halftime he brought out a number of guests including alicia keys her jermaine dupri lil jon and ludacris attendance was announced at 61629 at the relatively compact allegiant stadium the smallest crowd in super bowl history except for the pandemic game in tampa florida three years ago it didnt

get hit bennett said im not going to win many of those but its good to feel like a football player again its fun to get out there and compete bennett entered the game early in the second quarter and immediately led a 16 play 75 yard drive that included three near interceptions and a sharp 11 yard touchdown pass to fellow rookie  bennett led two more scoring drives after halftime finishing 17 for 29 with no interceptions he made mistakes but he also showed coach sean mcvay how hell attempt to overcome them if hes ever needed to play in place of in games that count its the first nfl game youre playing in and youre going to be a little nervous and try to make a play when sometimes plays arent there bennett said but then as it started to groove we started calling plays and started to settle

when he was taken into custody in the los angeles area graham was evaluated by the team doctor and released from a hospital on saturday morning theres been a lot im ready to try to get back home and

fridays joint practices directed three second quarter scoring drives for new orleans and the defense forced three turnovers but allen was perturbed that the saints committed 14 penalties for 141 yards look we won the game and im pleased about that but theres a ton of stuff that needs to get cleaned up he said i thought it was a hell of a week just in terms of the productivity of what we were able to get accomplished in the joint practices and then be able to play the game so that was all good chargers quarterback played the entire game and had a pair of rushing tds sticks 1 yard td on a sneak got the chargers within five points with 346 remaining after the chargers 1 1 forced the saints 2 0 into a three and out los angeles drove to the new orleans 28 yard line but lonnie johnson picked off stick at the saints 1 on fourth and 4 from the 28 i think that it was an uneven performance in the passing game for us we didnt protect the passer very well i didnt think that we threw it with accuracy chargers coach brandon staley said certainly the three turnovers that really told the story tonight stick who is being counted on to serve as justin herberts backup was 21 of 41 for 233 yards and two interceptions he also had seven carries for 63 yards it was the first time stick had played all four quarters in a game since he led north dakota state over eastern washington in football championship subdivision title game in january 2019 i appreciate coach letting me go the full game just disappointed the way it ended stick said i havent had a chance to play an extended period like that before it will be big for me to go back and watch it and learn from it new orleans got its lone touchdown early in the second quarter on s 7 yard run off left guard the saints started the drive on the chargers 33 after first round pick recovered sticks fumble stick turned it over while being sacked by defensive end  the rest of the points came on five field goals three by will lutz and two by  as we go out there and look at this film im pretty sure we gonna find something that we can execute better on but we are getting better every single day and im happy we got this win said winston who completed 13 of 21 passes for 169 yards after sticks 6 yard td run tied it at 10 with 33 seconds remaining in the first half winston directed a four play 49 yard drive that was capped by grupes 37

shocked some observers by putting up one of the best passing days in an opener in nfl history his coach wasnt surprised at all it was validating for me because i dont feel crazy thats kind of what i expected to happen coach mike mcdaniel said after the rallied for a 36 34 victory over the on sunday tagovailoa threw for 466 yards the fourth most in an opener and three touchdowns in a game that saw two ties and nine lead changes his 4 yard throw to in the right corner of the end zone with 145 remaininga put the dolphins ahead to stay i was super excited to be out there again said tagovailoa who completed 28 of 45 passes its the first game you dont necessarily know what to expect from their team they give us their best shot they ran almost everything that weve seen watching film so it feels good hill who said during training camp he wants to be the first receiver to reach 2000 yards in a season got off to a great start he had 215 yards  the third best total in week 1 in league history  on 11 receptions and two touchdowns i wanted to play fast and deliberate i kind of went into a zone there said hill who had his third 200 yard receiving game even during halftime tua was getting guys going he leaned on me a little bit toward the end and that meant more targets hill had two receptions on the decisive 8 play 75 yard drive on third and 10 from the dolphins 25 he beat on a go route and caught a 47 yard passa after tagovailoa stepped up in the pocket and made a pinpoint throw im glad that we started with this game hill said last year those guys did a great job of pressing us so i feel like this year like ive been saying we had a chance to go back and get a full understanding of the offense and you see that the results were different different would be an understatement in last seasons 23 17 win in week 13 the chargers held the dolphins to 219 total yards with 119 coming on two plays and didnt allow miami to get into the red zone tagovailoas 466 passing yards were the most ever allowed by the chargers and miamis 536 yards of offense is the most the franchise has yielded in an opener i dont think that we played the right leverages in the secondary and i didnt think that we rushed the quarterback effectively enough coach brandon staley said it turned into a track meet in the passing game chargers edge rusher blamed the defense for the loss but also acknowledged the brilliance of tagovailoa and hill i feel like its a rare occasion when youve got two guys like that on the field at the same time blazing up and down the field mack said weve just got to look at it and get better make sure we get better on the back end and the front end miami had nine plays of at least 21 yards those included hills 35 yard score late in the third quarter to put the dolphins up 27 24 had 37 yards rushing including a 2 yard td in the first quarter had four receptions for 78 yards kicked three field goals after hills late td the chargers turned it over on downs had an intentional grounding penalty and was sacked twice on the final series he finished 23 for 33 for 228 yards with two touchdowns one passing one rushing los angeles rushed for 234 yards and three touchdowns the fourth time since the team moved to los angeles in 2017 that it has exceeded 200 yards on the ground had 117 yards and a score the fourth 100 yard game of his seven year career added 91 yards and had a 2 yard touchdown run a minute into the fourth quarter to make it 31 27 i think we got some explosions some explosive runs that always helps when you have guys running down the field like that it opens up the pass game herbert said to be able to see the offensive line move the ball like that i thought that was really good for us offensively kicked two field goals for the chargers strong start after recovered the dolphins botched snap at the la 6 the chargers went 14 plays capped by ekelers 1 yard run off right tackle it was the second time in the past three years and fourth

third field goal of the game to force overtime the chargers won the coin toss but herbert threw three straight incompletions as tennessee forced just its third three and out of the game we had a tough

when leading by 10 or more tied for second most in the nfl since 2021 only baltimore six has more in that span herbert said theres a lot of football left for the chargers despite this start were not where we want to be right now but that doesnt mean that we cant get there in a couple of weeks herbert said both because of injuries for the chargers running back ankle and linebacker  their biggest

tested the patience of our team the connection of our team coach brandon staley said all three phases just hung tough  with 7 seconds left snagging a ball that deflected off the chest of diving tight end  on minnesotas previous possession knocked down cousins fourth down throw to at the goal line it was a hard fought win herbert said certainly not the way we drew it up the vikings 0 3 had their final chance thanks to staleys bold choice to go for it on fourth and 1 at his own 24 was stonewalled in the hole by  giving the vikings the ball with 147 left they sputtered through six plays aided by an illegal use of hands penalty on davis before a fourth down pass to hockenson gave them first and goal at the 6 with no timeouts left cousins had trouble hearing the play call and 29 seconds ticked off the clock until the next snap instead of the vikings opting for a spike cousins seemingly safe throw to hockensons outside shoulder away from the defenders still got picked off the type of bad break that rarely went against the vikings in 2022 while they set the nfl record by going 11 0 in one score games i hate the feeling of losing whether its a football game or its a board game said

grab with 50 seconds left before halftime in a dizzying final stretch between two potent offenses and teams in desperate situations cousins converted a fourth down pass for a 36 yard touchdown to late in the third quarter then he hit jefferson for a 52 yard score and a 24 21 lead with 1120 left herbert came right back with a 30 yard touchdown pass with 805 left almost made a diving interception but the ball slipped through his hands off his helmet and in the air to palmer at the goal line the vikings gave up 259 rushing yards last week to philadelphia but with out again the chargers abandoned the running game and why not herbert has the most completions in history for a players first four seasons with a whopping 14 games to go to build on that total elimination game in this game between 2022 playoff teams staley got the edge on his friend  who worked with him on the  staff in 2020 for staley and the chargers encouragement can be found in the fact that 31 teams have started 0 2 and made the playoffs since expanded the field in 1990 cincinnati did so last season for the vikings the road looks rough only four teams since 1990 have made the playoffs after an 0 3 start the chargers

how tough he is hes a clutch player staley said herbert  who didnt speak to reporters until an hour after the game was over  stole a line from monty python and the holy grail and called the injury a flesh wound but added that there will be further tests monday to assess its severity the good news for herbert and the chargers 2 2 is they have a bye next week theres never really a question it was just getting fixed up and going back out there he said the pain level is not bad its just one of those things that we have to monitor and see where it goes it wasnt the only time herbert was roughed up from raiders defensive tackle on the sideline after a 3 yard scramble during the second quarter tillery a chargers first round pick in 2019 was ejected herbert had career lows in completions 13 attempts 24 and yardage 167  but those totals included a big throw in the fourth quarter he hit for 51 yards up the left sideline on third and 10 from the chargers 11 to ice the game i thought it was

knock some of the rust off get in the game flow with some of the guys garoppolo said its the little things that were trying to work on and i thought the guys played well tonight  i wanted to play so im glad josh let the starters get out there and get a couple of reps in guys were operating at a fast pace which is important in this offense the game was garoppolos first action since last dec 4 when he incurred a season ending foot injury in miami before led san francisco to a victory and quickly became a rising star given garoppolos injury history and the importance of his health this season mcdaniels thought it beneficial for his quarterback to get back into the groove i think every quarterback or player that touches the football that knows once the regular season comes theyre live bait mcdaniels said theyre going to get hit its always good to get that out of the way and some of the anxiety about how it feels because you havent done it in a long time mcdaniels didnt reveal his plan for his starters before the game but most of the raiders probable key contributors got some action at sofi stadium even star receiver played on the opening drive although garoppolo didnt target him you always go through that conversation in your head every year mcdaniels said we just felt like with the number of new faces the number of guys that were basically going to play their first regular

to improve on bennett said there was times where it did slow down for me and there was times when it was going fast rams linebacker jacob hummel returned an interception 21 yards for a touchdown in

outplaying and at times dominating the to open the season stafford threw for 334 yards even without  and combined for three touchdown runs and the rams stunned the seahawks 30 13 on sunday i think were excited because we put the work in i think the cherry on top of this is getting to see yall reaction to it stafford said i think the big thing for us though is we care about it because we put the work in it wasnt given to us stafford was brilliant picking apart seattles secondary for the 58th 300 yard passing game of his career in the regular season he did so despite kupp being sidelined for the first four games of the season while on injured reserve due to a hamstring injury stafford found some new targets to use rookie had 10 catches for 119 yardsa and was targeted 15 times in the first game of his career had a career high 119 yards on six catches and the rams were at their best on third downs where they converted 11 of 17 chances leading to long drives and a huge advantage in time of possession los angeles had 27 first downs 426 total yards and 3923 time of possession this is football heaven for me of everything nacua said the game the way the game went being able to come back in the second half and just continually build on the pieces that i felt like we were building on in the first half and just continue to execute when we needed to williams had a 1 yard touchdown run in the first quarter and of the second half gave los angeles a 14 13 lead with 945 remaining on fourth and goal and left seattles fans booing the performance of the home team the goal for stafford head coach sean mcvay and the rest of the rams was to be competitive even after an offseason that due to salary cap issues saw most of the roster be gutted that left los angeles relying on several unproven players surrounding the few remaining stars on the roster the opener was a good indication the rams can be more than just the outside expectations the rams handed seattle its worst home loss since los angeles beat the seahawks 42 7 during the 2017 season including that 2017 win the rams have won nine of the past 13 games against seattle i couldnt care less whats said outside mcvay said there might be some change in narratives and that doesnt affect any way that well go about our business right now meanwhile seattle flopped entering a season where the belief was it could close the gap on san francisco in the nfc west but many of the issues that emerged last season when the seahawks ran into problems remained prevalent seattle couldnt get off the field on third down it couldnt sustain its own drives going 2 of 9 on third downs and settled for field goal attempts in the first half when touchdowns were needed the frustration with the performance became evident in the closing minutes when was flagged for taunting and was called for unnecessary roughness for a foul away from the play i thought we lost our minds a little bit and well talk about that seattle coach pete carroll said seattle had just 12 yards of offensive and only first down in the second half geno smiths second season as a starter got off to a rocky start as he completed 16 of 26 passes for only 112 yards in the first half but seattle had only one offensive play of longer than 15 yards you never want to see another team or the opposing team especially somebody in your own division play harder than you metcalf said im pretty sure theres a lot of mistakes that we have to clean up injuries seattle lost both of its starting offensive tackles to injuries in the third quarter with right tackle and left tackle leaving along with wide receiver  lucas was announced with a knee injury which carroll said was a recurrence of an issue that required lucas to miss some time in training camp cross suffered a sprained toe and couldnt continue carroll said lockett was hit by rams safety on a run play and was examined for a concussion but cleared protocol carroll said rams cornerback was injured late in the fourth quarter and did not return inactives seattle was without rookie first round pick as the young cornerback continues to work back from a hamstring injury that limited him during training camp

went 74 yards in 30 seconds and lined up at the rams 1 for one final snap before halftime just about everybody in sofi stadium knew that last play would be the tush push the brotherly shove or whatever  secret name is for  los angeles knew it was coming but still that put philly ahead for good thats what its like facing the powerhouse eagles these days they dont always execute perfectly but they just keep moving forward hurts passed for 303 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 72 yards and another score and philadelphia outlasted the rams 23 14 on sunday to remain unbeaten had eight catches for 117 yards and an early td for the eagles who are off to consecutive 5 0 starts for the first time in franchise history despite never pulling away in this meeting of the last two nfc champions philadelphia has won 22 of its last 23 regular season games its tough to win in this league so were really happy with where were at goedert said we do have stuff we need to clean up but its a good start for us had six catches for 127 yards but the eagles couldnt reach the end zone in the second half and had to rely on their defense which shut out the rams 2 3 after halftime hurts surge into the end zone at the halftime gun was the games final touchdown but that was enough for philadelphia not to pour more water into that jug but its something weve been able to do at a high level hurts said of the signature play which he calls by a name he wouldnt disclose its clear that it doesnt always work for everyone else so we just want to continue to execute whenever its called  we just want to continue to grow its truly about growing the eagles earned another road victory punctuated by another set of successful tush pushes but theyll also lament missed opportunities they racked up 454 total yards but failed to score at least 25 points for the first time this season philadelphia went 13 for 18 on third downs after struggling in that area last week still the eagles settled for short field goals by after drives lasting 17 plays 15 plays and 10 plays the philly defense covered for the offenses shortcomings with eagles rookie picking up two sacks in the stadium where he won a national title with georgia nine months ago also had two sacks at the start of the game they were getting the ball out to their receivers really quick carter said we knew we had to get to  faster and we did that  and it changed the game had eight catches for 118 yards in the former super bowl mvps dynamic season debut for the rams who have lost three of four despite hanging in with three probable super bowl contenders during that stretch kupp made five catches for 56 yards on los angeles opening drive but the offense only made one more td march stafford passed for 222 yards and hit and rookie for touchdowns but los angeles offense didnt cross midfield in the second half nacua finished with seven catches for a career low 71 yards  kupp made a remarkable return to the nfl in the first game since november 2022 for the 2021 offensive player of the year kupp missed the final eight games of last season with an ankle injury before getting sidelined early in this years training camp with a hamstring injury theres a few things that im sure im gonna look at tomorrow and just feel like man just didnt happen a little bit faster kupp said but it did feel good to be out there playing football again goedert caught a 6 yard scoring pass to cap philadelphias opening drive but the rams responded with a 14 play march that included six targets of kupp before atwells td catch los angeles went up 14 10 with 32 seconds left in the first half with a drive including two exceptional throws by stafford who hit kupp for a 39 yard gain before finding nacua in the corner for a 22 yard td but hurts still scored after the eagles got major help from rams cornerback  who committed 28 yards in penalties while trying to defend brown las made an impressive end zone interception in the third quarter to keep the eagles from pulling away but the rams offense couldnt capitalize on any opportunity i think were too talented of a group to keep losing these types of games coming up close against good

holes in the los angeles 3 4 defense in the fourth quarter racking up three long drives culminating in two tds and the chance to run out the clock to convert a fourth and 1 at the los angeles 38 on the final snap before the two minute warning i was getting it pickett said i was doing whatever i could to get it lets put it that way coach sean mcvay couldnt challenge the spot because the rams were out of timeouts and the play occurred just outside the window that would have resulted in a booth review it doesnt matter what i think mcvay said that was the spot they made im not going to sit here and make any excuses about stuff that didnt go down those plays shouldnt have come down to that if we executed like we were capable of the spot was the culmination of a strong finish by the steelers

no passes in the fourth quarter also missed two long field goal attempts and an extra point its just execution said stafford who failed to complete a pass in a fourth quarter with at least four attempts for only the second time in his 15 year nfl career we cant have chances to make plays that are going to change the game one way or the other and not make those weve got to be more consistent

responding with determination to a i dont know if i need to take that level of a shot every week to get going said a grinning stafford who played with a brace on his sprained thumb i know that late in the game fourth quarter were within a score i want the ball he added it just so happened that i had my chest run through the drive before i dont know if thats the thing that gets me going but sometimes its late in the game you could be playing as poor a game as you want to play but you play one great quarter youve got a chance to win that thing los angeles hung on only after returned from

still hurting obviously didnt do enough after the rams defense got a quick stop following staffords pick with 738 left to trim seattles lead to two points intercepted seattle backup drew locks long pass moments later and stafford drove the rams to the seattle 4 before they settled for havrisiks short field goal stafford looked sharp on a series of impressive late throws none better than a i thought staffords toughness was on display coach sean mcvay said maybe we should punch him in the gut right before the games huh los angeles defense also kept the seahawks out of the end zone in the final 50 minutes and the oft targeted kendrick came up with its biggest play i just felt like they were trying me a lot throughout the game looking my way and trying to get easy completions said

and the rams defense largely shut down the commanders 4 10 until the final minutes los angeles survived even after brissett relieved and passed for 124 yards and two tds on washingtons last two drives we were running downfield more and guys just made plays said brissett who had taken only three snaps this season for his new team after starting 11 games for cleveland last year it was exciting i had fun im out of breath a little bit but it was definitely fun to get back out there caught two td passes including a 3 yard grab with 146 to play for washington which still lost its fifth straight game the commanders were eliminated from playoff contention for the seventh time in eight seasons its tough that we got going late like that said  who had six catches for a career high 141 yards and a touchdown brissett has played football for a long time in this league and been a starter so he knows what it looks like i definitely believe he gave us a boost late in the game and im just happy for

winning streak ended with a painfully slow start and 458 yards allowed by their defense which even coach dennis allen acknowledged was confused at times by the aggressive complex pre snap motions in mcvays offense although this loss hurts its chances new orleans is still in serious contention for a playoff spot and the nfc south title because it finishes the season with two games against division opponents starting with tampa bay on new years eve we certainly would have liked to start the game and play better but we didnt allen said were not into the percentages we let an opportunity go by and now we have to get ready for the things we can control well regroup were still in this thing stafford had yet another outstanding game down the stretch in his 15th nfl season he has 14 touchdown passes and one interception in the rams last five games and he has thrown multiple td passes in five straight games for only the third time in his career hes extremely difficult allen said about stafford he is playing at an extremely high level some of the throws i saw him make were pinpoint on his back foot and under pressure there were some times we had some good coverage look they were better than us tonight williams who missed four games at midseason because of a sprained ankle still became the rams first 1000 yard rusher since todd gurley in 2018 with his latest impressive burst

stafford in the first playoff game hosted by detroit in 30 years against the lions team that drafted him first overall in 2009 stafford was dealt to los angeles before the 2021 season in a deal that sent rams former no 1 overall pick to the lions the rams went on to win the super bowl that season while the lions have turned into a winning team thanks in part to goff exciting for this team just to get back to where we are right now to be honest with you stafford said the opportunity happens to be in detroit which is fun for me on a personal level wentz helped make it happen when he scored on a 12 yard run with 456 to play and then converted a 2 point conversion pass to to put the rams ahead 21 20 it was a lot of fun said wentz who signed with the rams in november and had handed the ball off

scored on a td pass from wentz to  missed the extra point as los angeles kicking woes continued the rams have missed a league high 16 combined extra points and field goals this season they waived after he missed two extra points last week and brought back maher who missed six fgs and one pat in seven games earlier this season that didnt seem to help the cause san francisco had its own kicking

do your best and see what happens oconnell said not worried about the stats theres more things than just the stats especially responsibility in the run game and stuff like that that i need to improve on so i know i have a lot of work to go still oconnell third on the depth chart behind starter and veteran  played the first three quarters leaving with las vegas up 24 7 and the outcome well in hand

bright on lance who was taken third overall two years ago after the niners traded a bunch of assets to move up in the draft and select him with the hope he would be the clubs quarterback of the future

earn the starting job for this season niners general manager john lynch said in april however that the team from lance as part of his audition for the backup job lance on sunday faced a heavy raiders

wished we had back and thats always going to be the case but i think were definitely heading towards that stuff we need to have back in the first meeting between the franchises in las vegas the

josh mcdaniels didnt have an update on garoppolo after las vegas 21 17 win sunday and the availability of the oft injured quarterback could be a major issue going forward played the entire second half against the patriots throwing for 102 yards but whether he would be the answer going forward remains to be seen the raiders also could turn to rookie if garoppolo is out i think there are a lot of balls up in the air right now relative to jimmy mcdaniels said well have a little patience and see what the report is going to be im hoping for the best obviously well find out more and try to make the best decision for the team garoppolo played the first half before being ruled out with a back injury he completed 14 of 22 passes for 162 yards with a touchdown and interception then he gave way to hoyer its my 15th year hoyer said ive pretty much seen all the situations and really what it comes down to is playing football regardless of the situation the raiders have won back to back games to move to 500 at 3 3 and ended a six game streak going back to last season of not scoring at least 20 points this was the raiders 500th regular season victory as a franchise 10th best all time patriots coach bill belichick remains at 299 career regular season wins losing to mcdaniels his former longtime offensive coordinator this is the first time belichick whose first season in new england was in 2000 has started a season 1 5 with the patriots couldnt quite make enough plays here tonight belichick said had our opportunities and just need to do a better job here and really just about every area any one of the number of things could have made a difference we just need to coach it better play it better execute it a little bit better thats really the story again mcdaniels was one of many former patriots who had a major role in this victory garoppolo and hoyer played under mcdaniels in new england and  who had five receptions for 61 yards  spent the previous four seasons there as a guy who was with those guys i know there is a lot of talent on that team meyers said those guys can play football theyve had a bunch of change on the team over the last couple of years so theyre working on some things rushed for 77 yards for the raiders and rookie tight end caught five passes for 75 yards mayer had three catches for 41 yards entering the game patriots quarterback was 24 of 33 for 200 yards with an interception new england had just 259 total yards the patriots 1 5 have lost three games in a row they ended a 79 point scoring streak by their opponents and a 10 quarter drought without a touchdown las vegas took a 10 0 lead early in the second quarter when garoppolo completed a 12 yard touchdown pass to meyers the raiders extended the lead to 13 3 at halftime new england reached the end zone about midway through the third quarter on 2 yard run by  who scored on a direct snap and cut las vegas lead to 13 10 but carlson made field goals from 30 and 24 yards to give the raiders a two possession lead in the fourth quarter at 19 10 the raiders needed those points when  who is from las vegas scored on a 1 yard touchdown with 333 remaining in the game the drive lasted 930 covering 75 yards on 17 plays las vegas ended any doubts with and combined on a sack for a safety with 147 left credit the fight of our team mcdaniels said that certainly wasnt a picasso out there hitting milestones las vegas jacobs reached 5000 rushing yards with a 7 yard run in the second quarter he is the fourth raiders player to hit that number carlson made his 150th field goal with a 37 yarder

was no doubt the raiders were at long last enjoying themselves several players lit up after las vegas 30 6 victory over the on sunday the latest sign that times have indeed changed following  rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns rookie passed for 209 yards and antonio pierce won in his debut as las vegas interim coach had three of the raiders eight sacks las vegas held the giants to 275 yards in the raiders largest margin of victory since beating the 37 12 on nov 15 2020 the raiders scored nearly as many points in one day on the giants vaunted defense than it allowed in the three previous games combined 34 we talked about pride and poise and getting back to being ourselves pierce said everything thats going on is in front of us not behind us the team effort you saw today is what we displayed in practice thursday and friday giants quarterback left one play into the second quarter  hell undergo an mri on monday played the rest of the game and passed for 175 yards and a touchdown rushed for 90 yards on 16 carries this was the raiders first game since coach josh mcdaniels offensive coordinator mick lombardi and general manager dave ziegler were fired early in the week and quarterback was benched the result couldnt have gone much better for the raiders who led 24 0 by halftime which tied for their sixth largest advantage when not allowing a point its a hard situation what happened this week but i think the guys felt relieved and happy and super joyful that we could perform like this oconnell said so it was definitely rocking in the locker room the team played tight under mcdaniels rigid control but there was a noticeable ease in the locker room this week under pierce the former giants linebacker the question was whether that would translate on the field it did and from the beginning when las vegas went down the field and scored on a by wide receiver  by halftime the raiders 4 5 already had scored a season high in points and jacobs had already rushed for a season best 86 yards las vegas previous high was 21 points three weeks ago against the  with the final two coming on a safety the raiders offense ended a nine game skid without scoring at least 20 points jacobs who last season led the nfl in rushing nearly ended a 13 game streak without a 100 yard performance he was at 101 yards before losing 3 yards on his final carry the vibe and the energy is just electric right now jacobs said this is the most connected i feel like weve been as a unit oconnell was given the start this week over the ineffective garoppolo and  and pierce said it would be his job going forward the qb commonly referred to as aoc completed 16 of 25 passes for the giants the game couldnt have gone much worse they entered last in the league in total scoring and passing offense new yorks offense still hasnt scored a touchdown in the first quarter and it didnt reach the end zone in this game until early in the fourth quarter and then after trailing 27 0 at 2 7 the giants already have as many losses as all of last season when they went 9 7 1 and made the playoffs definitely sucks but got to be a pro about it barkley said cant make no excuses still got a long season ahead of us obviously im not happy that were 2 7 and with everything thats going on right now get on a flight rest up get ready for next week interceptions by and led to the final 10 points of the half for the raiders to all but end any doubt about the outcome las vegas outgained new york 240 108 in the opening 30 minutes i see what we do when we play cohesive defense on the line and the

helping the dolphins stifle the  fourth quarter comeback and overcome three turnovers for a 20 13 win hes the best corner in the league man hill said the way he laid out for that last pass just goes to show how much he cares about this team a lot of guys theyll knock it down theyll say ah i could land weird the way he just laid out for his team just really shows how he cares about his brothers ramsey also intercepted the raiders rookie quarterback earlier in the game he has three takeaways in three games with miami after missing the first seven with a knee injury i do feel great ive put in a lot of hard work ramsey said at the same time the only way to get ready for football and be really in football shape and feel like the guy that i am is to play more football and this is only my third game techinically im just now in my training camp preseason really was 28 of 39 with 325 yards two touchdowns and an interception for miami he also lost his third fumble of the season on a scramble on the dolphins opening drive hill caught his league leading eighth touchdown of the season and had 146 yards on 10 catches caught tagovailoas other touchdown an 11 yard score in the second quarter oconnell who finished 24 of 41 with 271 yards and three interceptions also threw a pick on las vegas penultimate drive with his team down 7 oconnell dropped back to pass on fourth down at miamis 38 when defensive tackle wrapped him up oconnell tried to force up a pass and came up with the ball for his first career interception im learning how hard the nfl is and how hard it is to win oconnell said kudos to our defense they played so well in the second half kept us in the game it comes down to our offense be better all around and it starts with me with 1055 left the raiders got the ball at the 50 after a dolphins punt but ended up turning the ball over on downs after a deep pass from oconnell to tucker on second and 17 that was originally ruled a catch was overturned las vegas 5 6 had a two game winning streak snapped and the victory by miami 7 3 strengthened its hold atop the afc east the jobs not done tagovailoa said theres nothing accomplished being 7 3 on the raiders opening drive miami linebacker punched the ball out of the hands of rookie tight end for what was originally called a fumble returned by safety for a dolphins touchdown officials overturned it to an incomplete pass after a short review but the play forced a las vegas punt on the next drive jarred the ball loose from tagovailoas grip on a third down scramble deep in dolphins territory miamis defense then held the raiders to a field goal which nailed from 34 yards for a 3 0 lead the sequence repeated itself late in the first half dolphins rookie tight end  on just his second catch of the year fumbled at miamis 32 and it was recovered by  miamis defense which entered allowing fewer than 17 points in two straight outings held again and forced a 47 yard field goal by carlson the dolphins took a 14 13 lead into the half the raiders had little offense for much of the game outside of  who finished with 82 yards receiving including a 46 yard touchdown the dolphins finished with 422 yards of offense despite scoring their fewest points at home all year but they remain undefeated at home this season thanks to a defensive unit that held its opponent scoreless for the second straight game i like when they score 70 a lot more said phillips who had two sacks two tackles for loss and three quarterback hits today we scored 20 and they scored 13 and we won our defense had confidence in each other no matter what the score was we had the lead and we were going to keep it injuries raiders s left in the second quarter with a neck injury and did not return dolphins rb devon achane who

achanes teammates are learning to brace for a big play each time the rookie running back touches the ball achane delivered sunday with a 76 yard rushing touchdown that helped the to a 31 16 win over the  he averaged 137 yards on 11 carries for a total of 151 yards becoming the first dolphins player with three straight 100 yard rushing games since in 2016 its very promising to know that he knows where hes going to line up said quarterback  and then basically if hes getting the ball you know its going to be a big play more often than not the dolphins 524 yards gave them 2568 for the season which is the most yards through the first five games of a season in nfl history with the win miami 4 1 regained first place in the afc east after the 3 2 lost to jacksonville in london earlier sunday tagovailoa was 22 for 30 for 308 yards with two touchdown passes and two interceptions the giants returned one of the interceptions 102 yards for new yorks only touchdown it was the giants first touchdown in the first half of a game this season the 102 yard interception return tied for the longest in giants history giants quarterback left in the fourth with a neck injury after a sack by linebacker  replaced jones with 1211 left and led the giants on a scoring drive capped by a 51 yard field goal by  jones had x rays after the game and will undergo imaging tests on monday to determine the severity of the neck issue weve got to figure out a way to protect him better giants coach brian daboll said achanes 76 yard touchdown in the second quarter helped miami to a 17 10 halftime lead and made him the only player in the super bowl era with seven touchdowns through his first four nfl games he had four touchdowns against denver in week 3 and two against buffalo last sunday achane reached 2176 mph on his touchdown run according to nfl nextgen stats caught a pass from tagovailoa on miamis next drive that went for 64 yards hills top speed on that play was 2201 mph which is the fastest ball carrier speed in the nfl this season the dolphins are responsible for the seven fastest speeds in the nfl three belong to hill and three to achane  who had a 2 yard rushing score sunday has the other its real deal speed and that was the deciding factor giants linebacker said explosive plays won them the game i thought we played good defense in spurts but weve got to play a full game hill hauled in eight passes for 181 yards topping 150 yards receiving for the 13th time in his career he tied calvin johnson for the third most such games in a players first eight nfl seasons joining lance alworth 17 and jerry rice 16 hill also had a 69 yard touchdown catch on miamis opening drive of the third quarter that put the dolphins ahead 24 10 he was flagged for taunting after the play to give the ball to his mother the ref came and told me he was like you got a taunting penalty for jumping in the stands hill said im like bro you wouldve done the same thing for your mom too so why would you give me a flag for that the dolphins averaged 97 yards per play and their pass rush looked better after struggling to impact last week miami had 14 quarterback hits and seven sacks those plays kept the dolphins ahead despite self inflicted wounds that prevented them from further pulling away from the giants sometimes the messy games are my favorite with regard to that stuff dolphins coach mike mcdaniel said you turn the ball over thats hard but the best way to separate yourself is to be able to come back from that and progress forward the giants 1 4 forced a turnover for the first time this season when safety forced a fumble of achane in the second quarter which edge rusher recovered the giants moved the ball at times  they had 268 yards  and forced three turnovers but only had nine offensive points to show for it gano missed a 55 yard field goal attempt in the first then converted a 48 yarder for new yorks only offensive score of the first half caught tagovailoas

positions to win hurts rebounded from a pick 6 to hit brown with the winning touchdown on the next drive and he threw for 279 yards and combined for three scores to lead the to a 31 17 win over the on sunday night hurts offered little about whats wrong but when asked if it was an injury that could impact the star qb moving forward hurts only said i hope not of course the eagles hope not too  they started 13 1 last season before hurts broke his clavicle and they lost two straight games hurts still finished with his 13th career game with a passing and rushing touchdown he played the rest of the game and he played at a really high level eagles coach nick sirianni said man hes a competitor theres nobody else id rather have as our quarterback the super bowl teams from last season the champion and eagles are the only 6 1 teams in the nfl hurts threw two more interceptions but found brown 10 times for 137 yards  his fifth straight game of 125 plus yards  to get by his former alabama teammate

eating drive late in the fourth before hurts hit brown for a 42 yard reception and sealed the win with a 3 yard touchdown run as he has been much of the season hurts was more erratic than dynamic

tagovailoa was all out of dramatic rallies in this one if youre going to lose games you want it to be against a really good team and you want it to hurt coach mike mcdaniel said hurts threw a 19 yard td pass to for a 10 3 lead in the second quarter the eagles had a minor scare when brown spent time in the medical tent the wideout took a hard hit to the cheek and briefly had blurred vision but seemed fine when he dashed out of the tent and onto the field on fourth and 3 and hauled in a 32 yard pass that took the eagles to the 1 yard line nfl fans watching were stumped on what the eagles would do next maybe a play action pass a trick play uh no it was the tush push of course hurts lined up under center the offensive line surged forward and hurts got a big push from behind into the end zone for a 17 3 lead people cant do it like we can do it eagles coach nick sirianni said dont ban this play if everybody could do it everybody would do it miami and its league best offense wasnt out of the game yet the dolphins five wins this season have come against teams with a combined record of 8 25 the only team they had faced with a winning record is buffalo 4 3 miami lost that game 48 20

in stride for a touchdown with 39 seconds left that pulled them to 17 10 you have to feel what its like to play such a good team on the road mcdaniel said your margin for error is so small its an important building block along your progression for the season struggling dolphins the eagles limited the no 1 offense in the nfl to just 244 total yards the dolphins had scored 30 plus points four times this season and the 17 points was a season low we made them one dimensional sirianni said the dolphins had season lows in the first half with 10 points and 113 yards all of these games help us

three weeks scored two more touchdowns to  threw for 224 yards and a score and the dolphins shut out the jets 30 0 on sunday a you cant do anything about the past and the future doesnt exist mcdaniel said they really leaned into the day each and every day this week and i was very proud as proud as ive been of any performance from this team since ive been here mostert untouched on a 2 yard run that put afc east leading miami 10 4 ahead 7 0 and gave the ninth year running back his 17th rushing touchdown of the season  one more than ricky williams who set the record in 2002 the score was also mosterts 19th overall which broke the team record of 18 set by mark clayton in 1984 mostert said it felt great to break both records but he wasnt satisfied with his overall performance i felt like i didnt help my team enough in the run game said mostert who had 42 yards on 15 carries its just a standard that i set for myself tagovailoa was 21 of 24 with an 875 completion percentage and a a he was replaced by with 832 remaining and the dolphins up by 30 a week after threw for over 300 yards against houston the jets third year quarterbacks day was cut short when he left late in the second quarter with a concussion new york 5 9 had just 103 total yards of offense and was shut out for the first time since losing 26 0 at denver in week 3 of the 2021 season the loss combined with wins by houston and cleveland eliminated the jets from playoff contention for the 13th straight season  and severely lessened the chances of returning this season from a torn achilles tendon rodgers has said one of the conditions of his comeback would be new york remaining in contention its disappointing jets coach robert saleh said starting from the first series of the year all the way to now its just been a constant battle i do appreciate the heck out of our guys we still got three games left to finish strong hill who entered week 15 as the nfls leading receiver missed the first game of his dolphins tenure after injuring his left ankle against the titans his absence made room for a standout game from waddle who had a season high 142 yards on eight catches waddle got behind jets cornerback for a 60 yard touchdown catch from tagovailoa in the second quarter that put the dolphins ahead 17 0 mostert then gave the dolphins a 24 point halftime lead  a 1 yard score in which he was again untouched when a guy like tyreeks out its not just one player that has to step up waddle said its the whole unit when you have a hall of fame guy like cheetah missing wilson spent much of his afternoon running from a domineering miami defensive front that sacked him four times one of which that gave the dolphins the ball at the jets 1 and led to mosterts first score wilson was 4 of 11 with 26 yards before being replaced by  who was 14 of 26 with 110 yards and two interceptions to safety  despite missing several defensive starters the dolphins limited the jets to just 4 yards in the first half the fewest yards allowed in the first half of a game since dec 13 2015 when denver limited the raiders to minus 12 yards in the first half game changing chubb miamis high priced edge rusher had his best game since being traded to the dolphins last november with seven combined tackles and two strip sacks three sacks total chubb also had three quarterback hits two tackles for loss and a fumble recovery for miamis no 9 ranked defense he leads the nfl with six forced fumbles i was thinking of how we were on the field last game and didnt get the job done chubb said my main thing is just trying to better this defense in whatever way i can injuries jets dl left with a hip injury and didnt return  s left to be evaluated for a head injury but was later cleared to return  dl meyers

to see ty and see what he can handle as far as all the phases of our offense oconnell said calling plays for him here and there in the first half i found myself wanting to get him touches and thats always a good thing only a handful of starters played for either team seattle played center and right guard on offense and linebacker  edge rusher and cornerback on defense all five were out of the

first round pick out of southern california had a 22 yard reception for his only official grab but it was a catch that didnt count that stole the highlights along the sideline in the first quarter that was ruled incomplete but television replays showed addison made a spectacular grab and dragged his toes the catch should have been ruled complete but the vikings opted not to challenge seattle

moment for the vikings fumbled a 30 yard catch into the end zone and out of bounds for a touchback with minnesota trailing 10 7 in the second quarter no ones more torn up about that one than justin

the situation at that point brown had only four targets he finished with four catches for 29 yards the conversations we have on the field are going to be private sirianni said yall dont need to know what was going on out there browns complaints were no big deal to hurts everybody wants to make plays everybody wants to contribute he said i have no worries about him hes a great teammate a great friend kicked a pair of field goals for the eagles including a 61 yarder to conclude the first half after jeffersons fumble maybe its the adjustment to new offensive coordinator  maybe it was the short week maybe it was hurts and the bulk of the starters sitting out preseason games but whatever the reason the eagles were sluggish early for the second straight week and lacked that big play spark that made them a must watch offense last season the vikings blitzed and pressured hurts early and he could not break plays open as easily as he routinely did last season with hurts not his usual self again after a pedestrian effort in a win at new england the eagles turned to the run game and run and run and run they did 13 times on a 16 play drive that ended with hurts using his signature rugby style qb sneak to score on a 1 yard run for a 10 7 lead we didnt play our cleanest game sirianni said i think the first week was a cleaner game for the defense and not as clean for the offense

just short of victories in their first two games staring at a rare 0 3 for the proud franchise they got better in a hurry  of course they did  against a familiar foe jones threw a touchdown pass to  matt judon had a late safety and the patriots extended their winning streak over the to 15 games with an ugly 15 10 victory on a rainy sunday when we had to make plays we did jones said definitely inconsistent got to be happy with the win thats all we came here for bill belichicks bunch avoided its first 0 3 start since the coachs first season in new england in 2000 while continuing the teams mastery over its afc east rivals its been like this three weeks in a row for us said belichick whose patriots lost 25 20 to philadelphia in week 1 and 24 17 to miami last weekend it was good to come out on the good end of it made his second start in place of the injured  but was unable to produce much other than one solid possession in the fourth quarter that got the jets 1 2 back into the game capped new yorks 13 play 87 yard drive with a 1 yard touchdown run up the middle to make it 13 10 with 524 left after a defensive stop the jets faced third and 10 from their own 10 and wilson ran for a first down  but it was erased by a holding penalty by rookie guard  judon brought down wilson in the end zone on the next play to make it 15 10 they started moving the ball and it kind of got them life judon said we really needed that it was good to get that and get some points for myself the jets got the ball back with 143 left  but again couldnt convert on fourth and 10 wilson threw a 1 yard pass to  turning the ball over on downs  and causing the remaining rain soaked jets fans at metlife stadium to boo new york had one more chance with 16 seconds left wilson connected with for a 29 yard gain to put the ball on the jets 46 after spiking the ball to stop the clock with 1 second left zach wilson threw up a hail mary that reached the end zone and bounced around a few times before falling just beyond a diving s hands weve all got to find a way to be better zach wilson said and i think the rest will kind of take care of itself there was a lot of slipping early the result of heavy rains that moved through the area and caused some of the paint on the jets logos in the end zones to smear with footprints from players working in pregame warmups new york was never able to get its footing the win over the jets matched the patriots mark for the most consecutive wins over an opponent new england beat buffalo 15 straight times from 2003 to 2010 capped the patriots first offensive series with a 48 yard field goal for a 3 0 lead ryland missed another 48 yard attempt early in the second quarter on new englands next possession jones lofted a pass to a wide open brown who streaked downfield for a 58 yard touchdown that put the patriots ahead 10 0 with 1138 left in the first half  who missed last weeks game with a groin injury got the jets on the scoreboard with a 52 yard field goal the patriots tried to add to their lead just before halftime but ryland missed a 57 yard try after a high snap but ryland rebounded by hitting on a 51 yarder on new englands first drive of the second half jones finished 15 of 29 for 201 yards ran for 80 yards on 16 carries and had 59 yards on 19 carries and the patriots played clean football on an otherwise sloppy day that was our goal no turnovers jones said we definitely did that zach wilson was 18 of 36 for 157 yards for the jets who went 2 for 14 on third down after going 1 for 10 in those situations last weekend at dallas obviously thats not good enough overall coach robert saleh said of the offense you know third downs we couldnt run the ball it would help if we could help around wilson in terms of the way we play but just overall it just wasnt good enough from coaching to the players line switch with jets left tackle on injured reserve with a hip injury the a from right tackle to the left side starting right guard moved to right tackle and tippmann made his first nfl start at right guard left guard and center stayed at their usual spots injuries patriots dl elbow and dl ankle left in the first half and didnt

patriots quarterback from the game  the second straight week coach bill belichick sidelined jones in the second half kamara said he expected tough conversations in the locker room following a 26 9 loss to tampa bay last week the response was exactly what he hoped it would be anytime you find yourself in a lull or rut  youve got to find a way to fix it fast kamara said sometimes you get those ruts and it compounds and it starts to just turn into your identity thats the one thing we didnt want to happen because we know what our identity is we kind of got a chance to put it on display today

worst shutout loss in team history for new england trailing only a 52 0 drubbing in miami against the undefeated dolphins in 1972 it also drops the patriots to 1 4 for the first time since 2000 belichicks first season in new england he remains a win short of joining hall of famers don shula and george halas as the only coaches in nfl history with 300 regular season victories it was a poor

plays before punting again pinning the patriots at their 10 to start their final drive following a holding penalty injuries commanders de williams walked off on his own power following collision in the fourth quarter roughing explanation washington defensive end was called for roughing the passer for a third down sack on jones in the third quarter for what appeared to be a clean hit on the quarterback the play kept alive the drive and led to a field goal that increased new englands lead to 17 10 referee adrian hill said afterward that the hit was clean but that the flag was thrown

with the  the veteran center barely noticed them that hasnt been the case in 2023 not with the franchise enduring its worst season in nearly a quarter century and with potentially seismic changes looming so yeah there was a sense of relief after a 21 18 win over pittsburgh on thursday night a throwback of sorts to the patriots many big wins over their longtime afc rival albeit with far lesser stakes the offense thats looked lost for a month gained some momentum behind s three touchdown passes the defense got the stops when necessary and new england 3 10 ended a five game losing streak while damaging pittsburghs increasingly brittle playoff hopes no one has quit in this locker room said andrews a two time super bowl champion were fighting were working were trying to get better thats all you can do thats all you can ask for it hasnt been perfect no it hasnt that didnt stop the patriots from coming into acrisure stadium and doing something thats become routine through the years changing the trajectory of pittsburghs season and not for the better the steelers 7 6 lost to a two win team at home for the second time in five days dropping them out of the top spot in the afc wild card race this stings pittsburgh coach mike tomlin said but well be back maybe the steelers play three of their final four games on the road all of them against playoff contenders had two touchdown catches for new england had 140 yards from scrimmage  72 receiving 68 rushing  and caught a td for the nfls lowest scoring offense which reached the end zone three times for the first time since

getting a w i love being on this side of the ball ill tell you that its a side of the ball new england has rarely been on in 2023 the losses have piled up at a rate not seen since coach bill belichicks first season in 2000 that was six super bowls and nearly a quarter century ago for three hours on thursday night the patriots found a way to do what they so frequently have done against pittsburgh make all the plays that matter belichick improved to 15 4 against the steelers and 10 3 against tomlin in this latest matchup between the leagues two longest tenured coaches belichick coached his 507th game moving past george halas into second place all time behind don shula 526 but its hardly a guarantee hell be back for another season with the patriots new england had totaled 13 points in its previous three games the patriots exceeded that in the first half with zappe hitting elliott for an 11 yard score before finding henry in the end zone twice to build a 21 3 lead their largest of the season the normally stoic zappe let loose when elliott scored on the games first possession the first time all year new england has reached the end zone on its opening possession its really hard to score touchdowns in the nfl zappe said youve got to celebrate each one touchdowns have been nearly as difficult to come by this season in pittsburgh yet the steelers have remained in the mix thanks in large part to their defense and an ability to thrive in tight games pittsburgh however has lost two of its last three one score games after winning its first six to start the season completed 22 of 35 for 190 yards passing for a touchdown and running for another while filling in for injured steelers starter  trubisky also threw an ill advised pass in the first half that was picked off to set up the first of henrys two scores and he inexplicably threw deep to a well covered on fourth and 2 at midfield with just under two minutes left pittsburgh got the ball back with 15 seconds remaining but had no realistic chance to score the steelers managed 264 yards of offense another step back for a group that briefly seemed on the verge of getting it together after offensive

and his 41 yard pass to on third and 6 in the final minutes helped new orleans run out the clock in a 16 15 victory over the on sunday im glad we won thats all i wanted to do said carr who spent his first nine seasons with the raiders before coming to new orleans as a free agent that was one of the more physical games ive played in my 10 years  we showed that we could win the ultimate physical type of game the saints defense did not allow a touchdown intercepted three times sacked him three times and stopped tennessee on 10 of 12 third down plays our defense is something special said cornerback  who had one of the saints interceptions along with and  were one of the best defenses if not the best defense in the league new orleans also got a big special teams play when linebacker blocked a punt in titans territory to set up one of rookie s three field goals shaheed an undrafted player in his second season out of weber state overcame his turnover on the opening kickoff and finished with five receptions for 89 yards and the games lone touchdown thats a very veteran thing of him to do carr said usually when young guys make mistake early its hard to get them back focused  he came out and caught a lot of passes for us in some big situations caught eight passes for 112 yards for new orleans  who missed the final 14 games last season returned to catch five passes for 61 yards the teams traded field goals punts or turnovers for most of the game before new orleans finally found the end zone with 123 left in the third quarter carr pump faked and lofted a pass toward the right side of the end zone an instant before the pocket collapsed shaheed before breaking behind the defense hauled in the 19 yard scoring pass to make it 16 9 after the titans hit two more field goals from 45 and 29 yards tennessee needed one more third down stop for a chance to win thats when carr hit shaheed deep down the left sideline it made my day carr said crediting offensive coordinator pete carmichael jr for calling a play that provided that opportunity it meant a lot to me and our offense that he trusted us  first down run shortly after allowed new orleans to run out the clock tennessee coach mike vrabel said he was banking on his defense forcing one more punt when he sent folk out for a field goal instead of running an offensive play on fourth and 6 from the new orleans 11 with 220 left if we want to be a great defense we have to be a great defense all the time vrabel said we tried to put the game in their hands and i thought wed get a stop when we made the decision to kick come down and get inside the 40 and try to kick a field goal to win the game tannehill finished 16 of 34 for 198 yards new orleans limited star running back to 63 yards rushing caught seven passes for 65 yards in his titans debut carrs first play from scrimmage as a saint was a 25 yard completion to thomas along the left sideline that was not however an auspicious sign of things to come in the first half which ended with carr being intercepted by safety on the titans 12 the turnover preserved tennessees 9 6 lead at halftime hard yards with star running back serving the first of a three game suspension the saints managed just 69 yards on the ground obviously thats a good front that we played coach dennis allen said we knew it was going to be difficult to run the ball  obviously thats something that weve got to improve on injuries titans db received attention for an ailing hamstring in first half but returned to the game dt received attention in the fourth quarter but was able to walk to the sideline hooker briefly received treatment in the final two minutes saints de left the game with a toe injury in the first half db limped off the field early in the fourth

thats how it looks four games into the 2018 top overall draft picks first season with his fourth team mayfield threw three touchdown passes for tampa bay s did little to help new orleans anemic offense and the buccaneers beat the saints 26 9 on sunday mayfield is a fighter with a ton of resilience hes been a great fit for us said receiver  who caught eight passes for 114 yards including a 42 yarder that set up tampa bays final touchdown you see him making plays scrambling taking some big shots popping back up  thats infectious for the team godwin said it makes the offensive line want to block more makes us want to run our routes a little bit harder and give him a chance because we know hes going to play as much as he can to give us a chance mayfields mobility helped him evade pass rushers and even scramble for a couple of third down conversions his arm meanwhile produced points mayfield completed 25 of 32 passes for 246 yards including tds to cade otten and as the bucs 3 1 took over first place in the nfc south it shows the accountability in our building and not letting the outside noise affect us mayfield said right now the narrative is going to flip  and we have to keep that mindset even more so you cant change whether people are patting you on the back or talking trash for the saints 2 2 the optimism that accompanied their 2 0 start has been replaced by soul searching ive got to make sure we put a better product on the field the next time we show up coach dennis allen said when you get beat like that youve got to look at it all if you just said it was all in the execution then that would look like a freakin cop out right so i think weve got to be better in a lot of areas starting one week after spraining  and after only limited work in practice the past week carr struggled to move new orleans offense which had accounted for just four touchdowns in the first three weeks and did not add that total in week 4 carr said his shoulder was no excuse for us playing the way that we did today he finished 23 of 37 for 127 yards and the saints could not keep up with the bucs on a day when they were hoping for a boost from star running back s returna from a three game suspension kamara touched the ball 24 times with 11 carries and 13 receptions but finished with just 84 yards from scrimmage new orleans took a 3 0 lead on its opening drive but didnt score for the rest of half mayfield meanwhile passed for a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter he bought time with his feet on third down before hitting otten for a 4 yard score that made it 7 3 mayfield was intercepted just short of the goal line late in the half by  but saints fullback fumbled the ball right back mayfield then hit palmer on a fade route to make it 14 3 at halftime mayfield put the game away with his 5 yard pass to diving thompkins with 344 left missed opportunities early in the third quarter carr had top receiver open deep downfield twice on one drive carr underthrew him the first time on the second safety antoine winfield recovered in time to catch olave from behind and make a diving break up in the end zone theres a couple of throws where i felt like it might have come up a little bit short and i dont know if that was relative to the shoulder allen said kamara helped carry the saints inside the tampa bay 20 late in the third quarter  gaining 41 yards on four runs and two catches  but they settled for grupes short field goal to make it 14 6 injuries buccaneers wr injured his hamstring in the second quarter bucs coach todd bowles said it appeared evans

everyone involved everyone making plays when we needed them thats the thing that feels good for me because theres a lot of hard work and things that go on behind the scenes that i was just really proud of today saints coach dennis allen made a point of complimenting carrs performance before hed even taken a question about the quarterback and called recent criticism of carr unfair my personal opinion but i thought he played really good in this game allen said just like with everything else when you play that position youre going to get your fair share of criticism and when somebody plays really good i think we need to make sure we recognize that he played well added 110 yards from scrimmage for the saints who remained tied atop the nfc south with tampa bay while ending a heady run for

sickening we didnt come out to play they got on us out of the jump we came out dry no juice no energy and they hit us in the mouth new orleans led 17 0 at halftime running twice as many plays 38 to tampa bays 19 and outgaining the bucs 202 yards to 44 up to that point mayfield was 5 of 10 for 43 yards passing through two quarters with most of his production coming on a 33 yard completion to  after turning the ball over just two times during their month long surge the bucs lost the turnover battle 4 0 to the saints it doesnt matter who we played today good team bad team a college team high school team we wouldnt have won tampa bay coach todd bowles said luckily we have one more game to seal this thing mayfield said again backs against the wall its somewhere weve been before weve got to get it fixed and move forward all you need is a chance to get in and were still sitting right where we need to be the saints played the second half without running back  who sprained an ankle late in the second quarter i think it was on the sideline in the first half right before the end of the half when he got tackled on their sideline saints coach dennis allen said he came in got it looked at came out after the half to test it out and just didnt feel like he was going to be functional enough to help us win new orleans rebounded from a loss to the that cost it a share of first place in the division the previous week ive never questioned the mindset of our team ive never questioned the toughness of our team ive never questioned the compete of our team allen said this game we play is hard its not easy theres some times youve got to fight back after a tough loss but i told the team last night weve got to handle hard well and i thought the players did that injuries saints wr shoulder

game 30 12 over the new york giants on thursday night they got a good bit of pressure on brock and caused a couple of three and outs but its about how long you can sustain doing that samuel said so in the second half we came out executing the niners werent particularly sharp on offense early in their home opener but got enough from mccaffrey and on big runs after the catch by samuel and to earn their second 3 0 start in 25 seasons the giants blitzed purdy on 33 of his 39 dropbacks according to nfl nextgen stats and he capitalized with 247 of his 310 yards passing on those plays including the touchdowns to rookie and samuel i thought it was just a huge challenge one of the bigger ones brock has been in with a short week to prepare for a scheme like that coach kyle shanahan said theres not a comfortable play throughout the game  i thought he settled down as the game went on mccaffrey ran for 85 yards added 34 more receiving and scored on a 4 yard run that made it 17 3 late in the second quarter that matched jerry rices franchise record with 12 straight games in the regular season or playoffs with a td and is three shy of the nfl mark the defense did the rest against the  who fell behind by double digits at the half for the third time in three games this season with the running game hampered by the absence of injured star and the offensive line overmatched without left tackle

downfield he went 22 for 32 for 137 yards and an interception we didnt create a rhythm jones said we didnt execute didnt take advantage of our opportunities thats a good defense a good team and when you are playing good teams you cant afford to do that we didnt play well enough good fortune purdy was off target in the first half but his numbers were pretty good thanks to some fortunate bounces and help from his teammates kittle broke up a potential interception on the opening drive and purdy had another pass to samuel that got deflected and bounced high in the air before bell caught it for a 15 yard gain purdy also converted a third and 15 and third and 13 on the same drive by throwing quick passes behind the line of scrimmage that samuel and mccaffrey turned into first downs slow

51 yard pass to  smith who returned for the second half finished 13 of 20 for 110 yards a battered jones was 27 of 34 for 203 yards he ran 10 times for 66 yards this was the giants second home game this season and both have been ugly there were mostly cowboys fans in the stands after a 40 0 season opening loss and the fans left at the end of this one wore seahawks colors id be upset too if i was

handoff and headed right inside linebacker broke through and seemingly made a tackle for a 2 yard loss for a moment everyone on the field stopped walker thought his body never touched the turf and he got up and ran 20 yards downfield stopped and then went to the end zone where an official ruled it was a touchdown there was a long review of the scoring play and videotape showed walkers elbow hit the turf the td call was reversed injuries seattle s sustained a concussion on the opening series after being hit in the helmet while attempting to tackle jones adams was playing in his first game

and the commanders who were limited to 46 yards in the first half recovered at the 21 new york held and the to 297 total yards in a 14 9 loss last week were playing pretty well right now said linebacker  who had 1 12 sacks and dropped a sure pick 6 at the washington 15 in the third quarter weve held teams to 21 points the last two games i think guys are doing their jobs and not making it

led the giants with two sacks six tackles and four quarterback hits refused to say the defense won the game i think as a team we have each others back he said one game the defense might not play well and the offense will have our back i think its just a collective thing and we just got to continue to fight and grow the giants who have been a disappointment after making the playoffs last season had to make one more stand after barkley lost a fumble inside the washington 5 led washington to a first and 10 at the new york 12 on fourth and 5 from the 7 yard line his pass was a little behind  and the receiver could not make the catch that last play i got to make it easier on jahan said howell who finished 22 of 42 for 249 yards probably a lot of people are going to say he should have caught it ive got to give him a better ball he was wide open the loss was the fourth in five games for the commanders the game ended when washington tackle was hurt on a third down kneel down by taylor since the commanders had no more timeouts the clock ran out being down 0 2 in the division is tough because to make the playoffs to get to the goals you want to get to you got to be successful in the

try a field goal late in regulation  but was wide left on a 35 yarder i have no excuses who was also wide left on a 47 yarder in the second quarter thats not who i am after ganos second miss the jets

turnovers and washington may have reached the low point of riveras tenure as coach with a 31 19 home loss sunday to the last place  the ugly game got even smellier afterward when there was no hot water in the stadium for players to shower it is a low point thats for sure rivera said 11 games into his fourth season with washington any time youve got an opportunity to win a football game and you put the numbers up you did and you get a chance youve got to come through his team did not the commanders 4 7 lost to the giants 3 8 for the second time this season this time to a who picked up his first nfl win in his second start washington has lost seven of nine since opening with back to back victories falling out of the playoff race despite a mediocre field of teams competing for three nfc wild card spots this is a winnable game right guard said the fact that we couldnt win the game im kind of at a loss for words to be completely honest with you sloppy football way too many turnovers after a late comeback bid was ended by picking off howell and returning it 54 yards for a touchdown with 16 seconds left riveras future and that of the entire coaching staff and front office is now squarely in the forefront in the first season since  ownership group bought the team favored by more than a touchdown the commanders fumbled in nearly every possible way after a catch on a kickoff return and  on a run inexplicable picks by howell  lauded by players and coaches in recent weeks as the  came in the first and fourth quarters when you turn the ball over that many times youre not going to win games said howell who was 31 of 45 for 255 yards passing it starts with me ive got to do a better job taking care of the football i didnt give my team a chance to win the giveaways made it impossible for washington to get back into the game against new york which scored a first quarter td for the first time all season the giants never trailed and won for the first time since oct 22 when they 14 7 at the meadowlands down the east coast the result was the same even with devito stepping in for injured backup  the 25 year old third stringer who still lives with his family in cedar grove new jersey completed 18 of 26 passes for 246 yards and three td passes two to and one to  tommy has put the work in  the players have confidence in him coach brian daboll said good job to the whole team win certainly proud of tommy the giants dominated despite allowing devito to be sacked nine times and rushing for zero yards as a team in the first half the defense stepped up with forcing a fumble and making his first interception among the big plays by the unit howell was also sacked four times in a back to earth game for the second year pro who entered with the most passing yards in the league he threw a late 8 yard td pass to and led another drive to the new york 48 before his third interception sealed it you cant turn the ball over and you cant allow a couple of big plays

rested with the rest of the starters  even after trask was lifted and was carted off and taken to a hospitala with a neck injury  a sign mayfield might have moved closer to claiming the starting job but bowles said he made a decision at the last minute to not play mayfield who was 8 of 9 for 63 yards and one touchdown in tampa bays preseason opener against pittsburgh last week trask listed with mayfield as the starter on the buccaneers unofficial depth chart led two scoring drives including a go ahead 33 yard toss to rookie that gave tampa bay 1 1 a 10 6 halftime lead we were going to play

planning to bring my helmet out for the second half trask said i thought i was done an equipment manager actually told mayfield to grab trasks helmet  just in case good thing he did trask was already

the big play clutch in crunch time machine that powered them to the super bowl brown saw hurts bring the heat that fire brown said he woke up a little today hurts threw for 319 yards and hit brown for two touchdowns and kicked a 54 yard field goal in overtime to lift philadelphia to a 34 31 win over the on sunday for its second straight 4 0 start elliott also kicked field goals of 41 47 and 36 yards before booming the winner that sent the crowd into a frenzy and kept the eagles unbeaten my whole career has kind of been a rollercoaster in terms of being in different and unique and unprecedented moments which you may call pressure and stormy and that fire hurts said but thats what i was born in i feel like its a unique feeling being in those situations because you work so hard and you prepare so hard and you go through so much to put yourself in a position where youre comfortable in those moments the eagles survived a little late game drama that put them on the brink of being upset at home by the commanders 2 2 for the second straight season hurts hit brown for a 28 yard touchdown with 128 left in regulation for a 31 24 lead instead of killing the clock and trying for a winning field goal the eagles left enough time for to lead washington to the tying score brown was flagged for taunting on his td giving the commanders a boost washington started on the eagles 36 and tied it when howell hit for a 10 yard touchdown as time expired coach ron rivera went for the extra point and the tie on the road a call that sent them knotted 31 all into ot the commanders did nothing with the ball in ot hurts then converted a fourth down sneak that pushed the eagles to washingtons 48 yard line and helped set up the winner sparked by browns nine catches for 175 yards and two touchdowns the nfc champion eagles are 4 0 in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1992 93 a year ago the eagles 8 0 start was spoiled by a home loss to washington the commanders tried it again and led 17 13 in the third and tied it 24 24 in the fourth hurts came as close as he has all season to the type of dynamic games that punctuated last seasons run to the super bowl he sure knew how to connect with brown hurts and brown are well past a brief spat on the sidelines during the home opener and are instead hooking up for game changing scores hurts hit brown in stride and the speedy receiver cut across the field and scored a go ahead 59 yard td in the third the eagles converted the 2 point conversion for a 21 13 lead brown wore bright green cleats a week ago for one series against tampa bay before he changed to the standard footware to avoid getting fined by the league he bucked the fashion rules again and wore highlight pink cleats  brown says the flashy colors make it easier for his young daughter to spot him on the field  and then had phillys biggest highlight of the game after the commanders rallied  s 15 yard score made it 24 all  the eagles responded and brown hauled in his score howell was 29 of 41 for 290 yards it was definitely a game i think we should have won and we were capable of winning it howell said we feel like we can play a lot better and that is a good thing we were really close against a good team a week after and was sacked nine times he went 13 of 17 for 161 yards in the first half behind an offensive line that gave him plenty of time to throw and take a 17 10 lead into the break yes the commanders used ball control  they had the ball for 17 minutes in the first half  to get a 1 yard td run from and s fumble recovery in the end zone for a 14 7 lead but the eagles did their best to give away the game they were penalized six times in the half and two were especially critical on the games opening drive linebacker was whistled for a holding penalty on third and 11 washington got new life and samuel scored the eagles also lined up in   formation at midfield on fourth down only to have a likely first down thrown out on a holding penalty the eagles punted  who entered second in the nfl in rushing had a 5 yard score that made it 14 7 washingtons and elliott each followed with field goals elliott opened the second half with a 47 yarder that cut it to 17 13 then the fun really began eagles coach nick sirianni appreciated the character trust and coolness needed for a team to pull out a win like this one he could just do without the frayed nerves thats not good for me when we have to win in overtime he said theres a lot of anxiety going into that injuries commanders db suffered a thumb injury eagles rg suffered a

box score almost needed a doublecheck to confirm that  yes the 49ers did indeed lose to the eagles samuel called one eagles cornerback trash and blistered philly as his most hated team in the nfl just for good measure samuel and some teammates arrived sunday dressed in black perhaps a knowing nod to the bleak day ahead for the eagles samuel backed up his big mouth with a blockbuster performance that showed the 49ers have plenty of room left to chase the no 1 seed in the nfc threw for 314 yards and four touchdowns samuel scored three tds and eagles quarterback was checked for a concussiona in san franciscos 42 19 win over philadelphia the fiery rematch also featured 49ers touchdowns on six straight possessions and a that showed this years title game might not run again through philly after all there wasnt much to last year with this 49ers coach kyle shanahan said we were just excited to come out here and play a really good team and play well and get a win the 49ers 9 3 left philly 10 months ago battered in the nfc championship game behind and his backup and they never stood a chance in a 31 7 loss the 49ers spent an offseason chirping at the birds  samuel called trash  and then entered the linc as a rare betting favorite against a 10 win team at home talking trash its part of the game samuel said hopefully no one took it to heart its all fun and games at the end of the day it wasnt much fun for the eagles the eagles 10 2 suffered a scare when hurts jogged off the field in the fourth and went straight to the locker room he was cleared to play and returned to action it was not immediately clear when hurts was injured he declined to get into specifics of the injury by the time last seasons nfl mvp runner up returned the eagles trailed 35 13 and were on their way toward their first home loss of the season hurts did hit for a 2 yard td on his return drive he finished 26 of 45 passing for 298 yards purdy put the finishing touches on the win with a 46 yard td to samuel perhaps all that braggadocio paid off for the 49ers hard feelings  highlighted by a scrap in the third quarter that got 49ers linebacker and the the eagles chief security officer tossed dom disandro a constant presence on the eagles sideline pulled greenlaw off smith after a reception greenlaw popped up and reached over two officials to touch disandros face with a closed fist greenlaw was ejected disandro a cult hero in philly for his ever present backup when eagles are out in public also was told to leave and walked to the locker room to a roaring ovation i love how we rallied after shanahan said the eagles offered few other reasons cheer purdy picked apart a defense that left receivers open for big chunks of the game samuel also inflicted his damage in the third quarter on a 12 yard rushing td and caught a 48 yard td pass from purdy that stretched a 14 6 halftime lead to 28 13 purdy got a kick out of samuel adding some added spice to an already anticipated rematch in the locker room maybe he was saying stuff that was fun for us to hear purdy said was it anything out of the ordinary deebos deebo his play did the rest it sure did samuel turned just four catches into 116 yards the scores were clutch in any game of course but they kept an eagles offense that made a habit of halftime rallies at bay and sucked the atmosphere out of the linc the eagles turned halftime deficits into wins in each of the last four games  including a super bowl rematch at kansas city  and five times overall this season the eagles have been outscored 144 156 in the first half this season one pesky detail among all those comebacks  philly never trailed against shanahan the 49ers are 33 1 including playoffs when leading by eight plus points at the break under shanahan hurts did his part in the first half to drive the eagles inside the 20 connecting with for 38 yards on the opening drive and to brown for 17 yards on the second drive the eagles instead had to settle for field goals of 26 and 39 yards for the 6 0 lead typically when you play to the standard you win hurts said i dont think weve played to the standard and won the 49ers shook of a first quarter funk that saw them finish with minus 6 total yards until purdy got the offense rolling in the second much like in the nfc championship game purdy was pressured early but he stayed strong notably on a scramble where he was popped twice but stayed on his feet and still got a 6 yard gain he capped that drive with a 2 yard td pass to that cut it 7 6  who finished with 93 yards rushing added a 2 yard score with 38 seconds left for a 14 6 lead the 49ers never really looked back  and maybe the black attire was fitting for this rout even as samuel insisted otherwise its just the outfit he said laughing it all

rookie season a year ago the answers came swiftly during san franciscos 30 7 dismantling of pittsburgh on sunday purdys elbow is fine his confidence too and his team potentially special operating the offense with precision and a dash of daring that took him from mr irrelevant to the nfc championship game last season purdy threw for 220 yards and a pair of touchdowns to  both with steelers cornerback in coverage  to calm any doubts about whether his stunning rise in 2022 was a fluke purdy shut some haters up 49ers defensive end said peterson among them the eight time pro bowler who signed with the steelers in the offseason said in the run up to the game he respected purdys play but would still find a way to get his hands on the ball what peterson got instead was a close up look at aiyuk celebrating in the end zone peterson slipped in the first quarter when aiyuk darted inside for an 8 yard touchdown he was in perfect position in the second quarter when aiyuk when streaking down the sideline it didnt matter purdy aimed for aiyuks back shoulder and aiyuk did the rest for a 19 yard score as the 49ers 1 0 quickly built a 20 point lead and never looked back was that on patrick peterson purdy said with just a tinge of faux innocence in his voice that one alright that felt good peterson credited the 49ers for a solid game plan but also pointed out he did knock down a pair of passes during other points in the game i had an opportunity to grab two picks he said i just didnt grab them he was hardly alone on a day san francisco pushed the steelers 0 1 around in ways that havent happened often under 17 year head coach mike tomlin particularly at home we got kicked in the teeth today in a lot of ways tomlin said on both sides of the ball christian mccaffery ran for 151 yards and caught three passes for 17 more for the 49ers 1 0 who looked every bit the dominant force they were down the stretch last season when purdy took over at quarterback bosa a handful of days removed from ever awarded to a defensive player had two tackles and a quarterback hit the 49ers didnt need the reigning ap defensive player of the year to wreak his unique brand of havoc to keep the steelers and second year quarterback in check san francisco had five sacks  three of them by second year defensive lineman  and intercepted pickett twice to dim the budding optimism in pittsburgh after he led the first team offense to five touchdowns in as many drives during in three exhibition appearances throughout the preseason they were hot you know 49ers linebacker said im sure they had a lot of confidence coming in and we just came out and executed pittsburgh either punted or turned the ball over in each of its first five possessions as the 49ers quickly built a 20 0 lead while purdy cruised pickett stumbled he completed 31 of 46 passes for 232 yards the vast majority of the yardage coming with the steelers hopelessly behind then again pickett was hardly alone the steelers didnt get their initial first down until ran for 24 yards with less than two minutes to go in the opening half that drive ended with pickett throwing a a for a touchdown that briefly cut the deficit to 20 7 briefly two plays into the second half mccaffrey darted left and raced 65 yards down the sideline to restore san franciscos 20 point advantage getting escorted by lead blocks from aiyuk and fellow wide receiver ray ray mccloud on his way to the end zone when youve got wide receivers that block like that its a special feeling for a running back because you know and truly feel like your guys have your back mccaffrey said pittsburgh never threatened the rest of the way even with linebacker getting three sacks to tie james harrisons franchise record of 80 12 watt pulled even with harrison during a third quarter takedown of purdy harrison needed 177 games to set the record watt matched in just 88 not that it was any solace during an afternoon in which the gap between the steelers and one of the leagues elite teams was on full display its not just one person one play watt said theres so much more that goes into playing better that you can either look at this film and make excuses or you can look at it and learn from it and we damn sure better be learning from it injuries steelers longtime dt left in the second quarter with a groin injury and did not return  wr left in the third

that faced little resistance from seattle the steelers 9 7 pushed their way into the final week of the regular season with a chance at the postseason after two straight wins and ensured that mike tomlins team would yet again avoid a losing record we got to win out this is kind of playoffs for us so us executing right now is kind of the biggest thing harris said harris had not hit the century mark rushing this season his closest coming when he ran for 99 yards against cincinnati but he combined with warren for a running punch that seattle struggled to stop harris averaged 45 yards per carry and reached the 100 yard mark for the first time since week 17 of last season against baltimore warren added another 75 yards rushing and scored on a 18 yard run in the first quarter i thought he was determined as was jaylen tomlin said of harris i thought we got appropriate efforts from all parties involved and not to minimize it it was just a critical time and so if youre a competitor youre going to be at your best harris scored on a breaking several tackles on his way to the goal line before a final lunge to break the plane in the third quarter with a big assist from his linemen

rushing and a season high 468 total yards pittsburgh was the sixth straight opponent to rush for at least 135 yards against the seahawks i was really disappointed missing this opportunity right here at home seattle coach pete carroll said everybody was ready this was a great one and we missed it we werent right on defense in the run game again its been repetitive you can see it pittsburgh quarterback mason rudolph made his second straight start and finished 18 of 24 for 274 yards and hit the big throws when needed none was more important than a a on third and 6 early in the fourth quarter pickens made a terrific diving finger tip catch and led to chris boswells 26 yard field goal that gave the steelers a 27 20 lead with 707 left rudolph also hit pickens for 24 yards with two minutes left and seattle desperately needing a stop pickens had seven catches for 131 yards thats simple football right there when the run game opens up like that and keep pounding it and then toward the end of the game we catch them all in the box and i hit them on the slant pickens said seattle 8 8 had its two game win streak snapped and while the seahawks werent eliminated from the postseason they will need a victory and a lot of help in week 18 it was frustrating to be in the locker room of course everybody has a one off here or there and you see the result that happens seattle safety said threw for 290 yards and a 12 yard td to in the first halfa added 53 yards rushing and a 13 yard td in the first half but the seahawks settled for three field goals in the second half and smith committed one big turnover forced and recovered a fumblea sacking smith with seven minutes left giving the steelers possession at the seattle 16 and boswells 21 yard field goal with 431 left pushed the pittsburgh lead to 30 20 we wanted to control our own destiny obviously we cant do that anymore but theres no time for us to kind of feel sorry for ourselves smith said injuries seattle took two major hits to its offensive line starting right tackle abe lucas played the entire first half but went to the locker room early before the second quarter ended and was ruled out with a knee injury when the second half started carroll said lucas wrenched his knee and didnt necessarily reinjure himself as much as didnt have the strength in the knee to continue three plays into the third quarter center had to be helped off the field and was ruled out with a concussion tomlin said pass rusher came off late in the fourth quarter but thinks hell be ok up next steelers pittsburgh will be at

washington qb traded big throws and touchdown passes in the closing minutes but it was smith who had the the final chance at the victory and came through it was the third time this season smith has led a winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime i think it was a beautiful illustration of everybody did right down the stretch seattle coach pete carroll said thats all we ever hope to do when we talk about finishing is everybody just keep doing stuff thats right and outlast them and have the chance to win even if it takes us to the last play of the game seattle 6 3 remained tied with san francisco for the division lead and it was an important rebound effort after baltimore handed the seahawks a 34 point setback last week the second worst loss of carrolls tenure felt like we did a lot of uncharacteristic things in that last game smith said it was important for us to kind of get back to who we are today and i felt like we did that smith was 31 of 47 for a career high 369 yards and a pair of touchdowns he hit for a 5 yard td with 347 remaining which appeared to be the decisive score at the time smith completed 9 of 11 passes on seattles final two possessions and he connected with on a 64 yard catch and run touchdown in the third quarter the longest play from scrimmage this season for the seahawks smith also didnt turn the ball over for the first time since week 4 metcalf had seven catches for 98 yards and lockett had eight catches for 92 yards geno did a great job of going through his reads taking what the defense gave him not trying to be too aggressive but knowing when to take his shots lockett said along with the game winner myers made field goals from 45 twice 42 and 33 yards myers has made 17 of his last 18 field goal attempts after starting the season 3 of 6 howell and the commanders did their part in trying to hand seattle a second straight loss howell pulled washington even at 26 26 on a 35 yard touchdown pass to with 52 seconds remaining smith took over and made a pair of big throws to  a 17 yard strike on third and 4 and a 27 yard pass to the washington 25 smith spiked the ball with 3 seconds left and myers concluded his perfect day for seattle not just five field goals but five field goals under pressure carroll said he made some pressure kicks today howell finished 29 of 44 for 312 yards and three touchdowns he also threw a 51 yard td pass to running back  on the fourth play of the game and hit for a 19 yard td with 8 minutes left that tied the game at 19 all he was even better on washingtons final drive howell converted a fourth and 1 at the seattle 43 with an 8 yard pass to  three plays later on third and 10 howell dropped a pass over the arms of defenders and and into the hands of brown who sprinted untouched for the tying score it was browns first touchdown of the season robinson had six catches for 119 yards for washington which struggled to get a ground game going the commanders had just 68 yards on 14 carries we made some plays down the stretch but weve got to be better throughout the game to beat good teams like that howell said sack attack seattle edge rusher recorded a sack in his seventh consecutive game setting a franchise record mafe was tied with michael sinclair with sacks in six straight games but sinclair accomplished his mark across two seasons mafe got the sack early in the second half on a third and 10

rolling to a 31 13 victory over the seahawks on thursday night the 49ers 8 3 won their fourth straight against their division rivals and have a two game lead in the nfc west over seattle san francisco won its third in a row overall following a three game losing streak and picked up its 10th consecutive victory against a division opponent  running through arm tackles and breaking off a handful of big plays he rushed for touchdowns of 8 and 1 yards as the 49ers built a 24 3 halftime advantage ran for a 2 yard touchdowna on san franciscos opening possession and completed 15 of 20 passes in a nearly flawless first half for the 49ers we had advantage in the first half but that third quarter was tough and gave them some life niners coach kyle shanahan said that was returned for a touchdown by seattles early in the third quarter but avoided any other major miscues and put a capper on the victory with a to with 751 left that sent some seahawks fans heading for the exits ice in his veins hes such a good player mccaffrey said of purdy he makes plays all over the field and watching how consistent he is back in the huddle hes never too high hes never too low anytime hes got the ball in his hands if there is a play to be made he can make it purdy finished 21 of 30 for 209 yards and while he didnt have the perfect passer rating he did last week against tampa bay he outplayed the quarterback on the other side was playing banged upa after leaving last sundays loss to the in the second half with an injury to his right arm near his elbow hell have more bumps and bruises after the 49ers got finished with him smith was 18 of 27 for 180 yards he was sacked six times threw an interception in the first half and nearly had a few more throws picked off the seahawks first five possessions gained 15 total yards and when seattle tried to rally in the second half smith took a couple of untimely sacks the first half of this game we couldnt get out of our own way enough seattle coach pete carroll said smith also ran to argue with an official after there was no flag for defensive holding or pass interference on a throw intended for in the end zone that would have given the seahawks first and goal late in the third quarter seattle settled for a field goal and never threatened again from my vantage point i could clearly see him getting held and it affected him being able to catch a touchdown right there smith said seattles last chance at a rally ended when was stopped on fourth and 1 at the san francisco 21 with 414 remaining the seahawks 6 5 lost for the second time in five days and have dropped three of their last four seattle has scored just three offensive touchdowns in the past four games and has only one in its last eight quarters its been a tough stretch for us but i believe that things will turn around smith said sack attack san franciscos six sacks were spread around had two sacks to give him 7 12 for the season had 1 12 sacks while tashaun gipson and each had one was also credited with a half sack the 49ers have 15 sacks in the past three games its funny after the game nobody has any idea what their stats are thats a good problem to have bosa said benched seattle appeared to bench starting cornerback in the first half replacing him with  woolen was not announced as having an injury and remained in on special teams carroll said afterward there were concerns about woolen still dealing with a sore shoulder and thats why the change was made woolen missed a couple of tackles early in the game injuries seattle right tackle left late in the first half with a shoulder stinger and was replaced by  peters did not return san francisco backup safety sustained a biceps injury and did not return there is concern its a torn biceps that could
